下面，我就以《老友记》开始的一个片断为例，给大家做个 参考。 
[Scene: Central Perk，Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]
Monica: There’s nothing to tell! He’s just some guy I work with!
【反思】当我们说同事的时候，一般会用colleague或co-worker， 以后不妨变通一下，用 “ some guy I work with” 或 “ some guy from work”来表达。 
Joey: C’mon，you’re going out with the guy! There’s gotta be something wrong with him! 
【反思】当我们说约会的时候，一般会用“date”这个词，以后 也不妨用用“go out”。 
Chandler: All right. Joey, be nice? So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece? 
【翻译】“be nice”在此处若翻译成口语化的“积点德吧”会更 能体现当时的意境。以后我们在想表达“积点德”这个意思的时候 就考虑是否可以用“be nice”来代替。 
【场景转换】比如，你和朋友到酒店吃饭，结账的时候小服务生 少找了你们十块钱，你朋友发现后大吵大嚷，小服务生低头不敢吭 声。这时候你就可以劝朋友说：“Be nice，he’s just a kid”。 
Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk? 
(They all stare, bemused.) 
Phoebe: Just, ’cause, I don’t want her to go through what I went through with Carl-oh! 
【翻译】此句可翻译成口语化的“我只是不想让她走我和卡罗的 老路”。有的版本翻译成“只是因为我不希望她经历我和Carl经历过 的那些事情”，两相比较，你认为哪一个更能让你记住这个表达 方式？ 
Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It’s just two people going out to dinner and not having sex. 
Chandler: Sounds like a date to me. 
[Time Lapse ] 
Chandler: Alright, so I’m back in high school, I’m standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked. 
【翻译】“totally naked”可翻译成“一丝不挂”。 
All： Oh, yeah. Had that dream. 
Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there’s a phone... there.
Joey: Instead of". ? 
Chandler: That’s right. 
Joey: Never had that dream. 
Phoebe： No. 
Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don’t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. 
Monica: And they weren’t looking at you before? | 
Chandler: Finally, I figure I’d better answer it, and it turns out it’s my mother, which is very-very weird, because——she never calls me! 
【反思】当我们表达“我想”这个意思的时候，一般会用“I think”，有时候也可以用“I figure”来代替，表示“我琢磨着”等 意思。 
【场景转换】“turnout”在此处的意思是“原来是' 比如你正 在宿舍看书，同学走进来告诉你说校门口有人找你，你问是谁？同学 说不知道，是一短发女生。你一边走向校门口一边想，是谁呢？难不 成是她？到了校门口才发现，原来是你姐姐！这时候就可以用上 
“turn out” 0 
[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.] 
Ross: (mortified) Hi. 
Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Monica: Are you okay, sweetie? 
Ross： I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... 
Chandler: Cookie? 
Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out 
today.
Joey： Ohh. 
Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee. 
【反思】我们通常说“倒杯水”或“倒杯咖啡”，有人会用 “pour”这个词，其实没必要这么具体，用“get”即可。 
Ross： Thanks. 
Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
Ross： No, no don’t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? 
Phoebe: Fine!? Be murky! 
Ross: I’ll be fine, all - right? Really, everyone. I hope she’ll be very happy. 
Monica: No you don’t. 
Ross： No I don’t, to hell with her, she left me! 
【翻译】此处可翻译成“也是^她都把我踹了，去她的吧！”以 后有类似的情绪想骂人的时候，就可以用上“to hell with sb”。 
Joey： And you never knew she was a lesbian."(你一直不知道 她是同性恋？) 
【反思】此句我们通常会说“ And you didn’t know she was a lesbian all the time... ”，通过这句，我们学会了 “never”表达同样的 
意思。 
Ross： No! ! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn’t know, how should I know? 
Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud? 
Ross: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty 
well.
【场景转换】“take it pretty well”是口语中经常用到的。比如说， 你和女朋友一起岀去逛街的时候，收到了一位女同事的短信，说 “出差回来了吗？我们都想你啦!”正好被女友看到，你以为她肯定 会大发雷霆，没想到的是，她根本没当回事。这时候你在向朋友叙述 此事的时候，就可以说 “Much to my surprise, she took it pretty well”。 
Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A. M.，“I’ll never have grandchildren, I’ll never have grandchildren. ’’ was what? A wrong number? 
Ross； Sorry. 
Joey： Alright Ross, look. You’re feeling a lot of pain right now. You’re angry. You’re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? (Ross gestures his consent.) 
【反思】当我们表达痛苦的意思的时候，一般会用形容词，如 painful, upset等等。但在这里Joey却连续用了两个动词，而且是正在 进行时，更形象地描绘出Ross正在经受的感情折磨。 
Joey： Strip joint! C’mon, you’re single! Have some hormones! 
【反思】英语口语中经常用“have +身体的某一部位”来表示某 方面的品质，如have the guts (有胆量)，have a heart (发善心)等。 
Ross: I don’t want to be single, okay? I just... I just—I just wanna be married again! 
(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.) 
Monica: Rachel?! 
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren’t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! 
【反思】注意此处with的用法，我们习惯上会说“有个手里拿着 锤子的家伙”，既要说“手”又要说“拿着”，而英语只用一个介词 “with”搞定，充分体现了英文的简洁。 
Waitress: Can I get you some coffee? 
Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, 
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor, (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and—you remember my brother Ross? 
Rachel: Hi, sure! 
Ross： Hi. 
(They go to hug but Ross’s umbrella opens. He sits back down defeated again. A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.) 
Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? 
Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. 
【场景转换】此处keep表示存放的意思，与我们平时学过的 keep的用法有所不同。你可以想象成是自己上学的时候得了好多好 多的奖状，你一直把它keep在一个抽屉里做为珍藏。或者是你与初 恋男(女)友虽然分手了，但他(她)的信你却没丢，一直keep在 一个小箱子里。 
This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee) Sweet ‘n’ Lo? —I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out. 
【场景转换】freak out意思是大惊失色，这也是口语中经常用的 表达方式。 
And that’s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y’know，I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, 
I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 4 Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?’. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn’t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you’re the only person I knew who lived here in the city. 
【场景转换】drift apart是一个很形象的词组，形容两个本来要好 的朋友慢慢疏远了。我想这样的事情在每一个人身都发生过，你可以 回想一下你从小到大的那些好同学、好朋友当中，有哪些已经与你 drift apart 了？ 
Monica: Who wasn’t invited to the wedding? 
【反思】我们经常在说英语的时候把“婚礼”和“婚姻”搞混， 主要因为汉语中的“结婚”既可以表示“举行婚礼”，也可以表示 “已婚状态”，如结婚了。在此要仔细品味一下wedding与marriage的 区别。 
Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn’t be an issue... 
[Scene: Monica’s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.] 
Monica: Now I’m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she’s really not happy about it. 
Chandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide! 
Ross: (in a deep voice) I’ll have whatever Christine is having.
【翻译】“Christine有的我也要有！”这句话在我们的生活中也经 常见到，尤其是兄弟姐妹之间争礼物的时候。需要注意的是句子中 “whatever”的用法，表示“不管给她的是什么我都要”，如果只用 “what”的话则是另外的意思。 
【反思】我们在用have这个词做“有”的意思的时候，一般不 用正在进行时，而这儿的“is having”则强调了 “现在正”的意思， 值得借鉴。 
Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can’t marry him! I’m 
sorry. I just don’t love him. Well, it matters to me! 
(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.) 
Phoebe: If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. Joey： I say push her down the stairs. Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey： Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! 
(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.) 
Rachel: C’mon Daddy, listen to me! It’s like, it’s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me. 
【翻译】“It’s like”是口语中经常出现的，用于引起下面的话， 有点类似于我们说中文的时候用的“这么说吧!” 
‘ You’re a shoe! You’re a shoe, you’re a shoe，you’re a shoe! ’ And today I just stopped and I said, What if I don’t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y’know? Or a- or a hat! No, I’m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I’m saying I am a ha—It’s a metaphor, Daddy! 
Ross： You can see where he’d have trouble. 
Rachel: Look Daddy, it’s my life. Well maybe I’ll just stay here with Monica.
Monica: Well, I guess we’ve established who’s staying here with Monica... 
Rachel: Well, maybe that’s my decision. Well, maybe I don’t need your money. Wait! ! Wait, I said maybe!
