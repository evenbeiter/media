In a speech emphasising his break from American foreign-policy orthodoxy, Mr Trump said that the “gleaming marvels” of Riyadh and other cities in the Gulf region were not created by “nation-builders, neocons or liberal non-profits” but by Arab regimes that embraced their “national traditions” and heritage. He also pleased his hosts by announcing that America would lift sanctions on <b>Syria</b>. Mr Trump briefly met Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria’s president, and urged him to reconcile with Israel. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on Mr Trump’s itinerary.</p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2025/05/15/politics\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Donald Trump said some of the duties could be reimposed if no progress was made in further negotiations, but at probably a far lower rate than the 145% tariff America ended up levying on Chinese goods. Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, said America would now aim for a strategic, and not a general, decoupling from Chinese trade. In another sign of a thaw in the trade war, China reportedly lifted its ban on Chinese airlines taking delivery of Boeing aircraft.</p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2025/05/15/business\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Administrative tasks and grunt work take up almost a full working day of a middle manager’s week, according to a survey by McKinsey. Anything that cuts down on the drudgery of fielding holiday requests and writing up meeting minutes is welcome. Tools that make it easier to match employees to internal job opportunities, or help plug skills gaps, ought to help firms and workers.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But as ever with <small>AI</small>, it’s as easy to imagine things going awry. Perhaps one day the job of a manager will become more about supervising <small>AI</small> agents. For now, however, people matter. And if the technology is seen only as a way to cut managers, or encourages humans to indulge their worst instincts, the workplace will suffer. Turning bad bosses into good ones will need more fundamental problems to be addressed.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">First, the risk of over-aggressive cost-cutting. Layers of bureaucracy can accrete even in the most successful companies. Andy Jassy, the boss of Amazon, is among those trying to get rid of middle managers who “want to put their fingerprint on everything”. Microsoft is targeting managerial bloat, too. <small>AI</small> smooths the path to such lay-offs, many of which are warranted.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But good middle managers are the unsung heroes of many organisations. They bring down quit rates among front-line employees. They are closer to the customer than <small>C</small>-suite types. They act like ribosomes, translating the plans of the higher-ups into something real. The risks of full-blown automation have already become apparent. Klarna, a fintech company, now says that lower costs weighed too heavily in its rush towards <small>AI</small> customer-service assistants. The same danger applies to bosses. You can have too many; you can also have too few.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The second risk is that <small>AI</small> encourages people to behave in perverse ways. Machines could substitute for human attention, rather than enabling more of it. Research shows that more one-on-one time with a manager helps reduce employee turnover. But if an <small>AI</small> can feed bosses the latest employee-sentiment scores, they may spend less time actually talking to workers. If your manager starts emailing you back faster than usual but the message ends with a cut-and-paste “would you like me to write this in a chattier style?”, will you feel more motivated?</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Moreover, as more things are measured, they invariably turn into targets. An <small>AI</small> that measures how often <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/01/your-ai-meeting-notes-are-ready\">individuals pipe up in meetings</a> may prompt bosses to encourage quieter sorts to give their views. Maybe. It may also incentivise even more people to ramble on when they have nothing of value to say.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The third risk of <small>AI</small> is that it distracts from tackling deeper problems. The best way to raise the quality of bosses is to make sure that people want to do the job in the first place, and are given the resources to perform well. In Britain four out of five new managers receive no formal training. Far too many bosses still take on the responsibility of direct reports because they are good at other things. Better sales performance increases the likelihood of American salespeople being promoted, for example, but is also associated with worse performance among their new underlings.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><small>AI</small> does have huge potential to improve management. But as the latest season of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/10/02/introducing-boss-class-from-the-economist\" target=\"_blank\">Boss Class</a>, our subscriber-only podcast on how to be a good manager, makes clear, the job of leaders is to blend efficiency and humanity. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/12/the-myths-of-corporate-innovation\">Innovation</a> depends on planning and creativity: Lego gives its designers room to let imaginations roam but within the constraints of launch calendars and supply chains. Culture is the secret sauce of many organisations: a Toyota plant is not just a car factory but also a belief system. Lime’s boss credits both prioritisation and a sense of mission with getting the e-bike firm through the pandemic. Management can be learned. But it cannot all be codified. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/opinion\">Opinion newsletter</a>, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/05/13/how-to-handle-the-ai-manager-advice-from-our-new-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The first occasion was in the year 800 when Leo III placed a crown on his head and proclaimed him emperor of a reborn Roman Empire. More recently, it has become a ritual for a new pope—the latest is another Leo—to thank the scribes who have covered his election, this time including your columnist. Since 2005 the death of a pope has also been marked by a new ritual. Barely is the poor man’s body cold than articles appear in Italian newspapers arguing that the chances have never been better of a return to normality (John Paul II had been the first non-Italian pope for 455 years) and predicting that the next pope will be an Italian. When lists are published of cardinals deemed <i>papabile </i>(literally, pope-able), half or more are invariably Italians. Non-Italian commentators, who assume their Italian counterparts have an inside track, repeat these names until, by the time the cardinals are locked into the Sistine Chapel, it has become a near-certainty they will choose an Italian. It happened again this time. The odds on Pietro Parolin becoming pope had shrunk to 6 to 4 on; but it was an American who emerged onto the balcony of St Peter’s.</p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/05/15/leo-xiv-will-pose-some-tricky-problems-for-giorgia-meloni\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Britain has conducted “a one-nation experiment in open borders”, he argued while unveiling a new immigration policy on May 12th.

For much of the 2010s <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/03/18/without-realising-it-britain-has-become-a-nation-of-immigrants\">net migration</a> (immigration minus emigration) was between 200,000 and 300,000 a year. Covid-19 cut it to almost nothing. Then it surged, reaching 900,000 in the year to June 2023. Whereas most immigrants in the 2010s were Europeans, most these days are from farther afield (see chart 1).</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">After leaving the <small>eu</small> in 2020 Britain created an immigration system that treated people from every country the same. The bar to entry was low. Salary thresholds for work visas were set at modest levels; health and care workers were welcomed; foreign students were invited to work after graduating. Combined with generosity to Hong Kongers and Ukrainians, the changes pushed up migration numbers.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">On May 22nd the Office for National Statistics will release new estimates of net migration to 2024. They will almost certainly show a dramatic fall from the extraordinary heights reached after Brexit. But the government is determined to push the figure lower. To do that it will press down on almost every kind of immigration.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Eligibility for work visas will be restricted, and care workers will no longer receive them. Companies that want to hire foreigners will have to convince a new outfit, the Labour Market Evidence Group, that they are straining to train natives—and pay a higher levy. Most graduates will be given work visas for 18 months, not two years as at present. People who want to join their spouses will have to speak basic English.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Most striking, though for now most vague, are the government’s plans to make migrants wait longer for settlement and citizenship. Currently many can apply for settlement after five years. That will rise to ten years, although exceptions will be made. The change is likely to retard migrants’ integration, says Madeleine Sumption of the Migration Observatory, a think-tank at Oxford University. But it will be a boon to the government, since migrants will keep paying fees while in limbo.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">To misquote P.G. Wodehouse, it is not difficult to distinguish between the government’s plan and a ray of sunshine. The worst is assumed of everyone. Immigrants are said to be undercutting native workers. Businesses are hooked on them, and have grown lazy about training. Student visas are misused, as is the asylum system. Community cohesion is eroded. But has Britain’s brief experiment in liberal immigration policy really been such a disaster?</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC354.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In economic terms, it has not. Foreign students have shored up universities’ finances, allowing them to get by even as domestic tuition fees have fallen in real terms. Those who work in Britain after graduating, and go on to receive skilled-worker visas, earn almost exactly as much as recent British university graduates.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Migrants from outside Europe start by earning less than Britons, but soon catch up. Indeed, recent arrivals are overhauling the natives even more quickly than earlier ones did (see chart 2). Jonathan Portes, an economist at King’s College London, points out that many migrants do not arrive on work visas; others might be family members, students or asylum-seekers. The decision to lower the bar for economic migrants could have made them a bigger share of the immigration population, making it more dynamic overall.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">An honest reckoning of Britain’s experiment in liberal immigration policy would admit that it has been an economic success but a political failure. That is the trade-off Sir Keir must grapple with. His government could succeed in pushing immigration down. If Britons feel a little more pinched and a little poorer as a result, they might not thank him. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in&nbsp;Britain,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty\">sign up</a>&nbsp;to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/12/britains-experiment-with-liberal-immigration-policies-is-over\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The anticipated global slowdown worsens the outlook for the British economy. But it has also pushed down the wholesale price of oil and gas as expectations of demand fall.

David Cameron’s victory of 2015 was preceded by two years of tumbling prices on a global oil glut. <i>The Economist</i>‘s analysis of opinion polling since 1990 finds that British prime ministers tend to enjoy a slight bump when petrol prices fall. (Disentangling the effect of any single variable on public opinion is tricky, especially because falling petrol prices have historically coincided with periods of economic tumult.) And the motoring lobby is powerful:&nbsp;Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has stuck with an eye-wateringly expensive Conservative policy of refusing to increase fuel duty with inflation.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Ministers are reluctant to trumpet positive data, after the experience of Rishi Sunak, a Tory prime minister, who they thought looked out of touch with squeezed voters when he declared victory over inflation. But there are glimmers of hope. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025, according to new data. Real wages are increasing. Interest-rate cuts are reducing the cost of mortgages. Supermarkets are preparing for a price war. If Britain strikes a deal with the <small>EU</small> to harmonise its agricultural-import rules, ministers will sell it not as a victory for European integration but as a recipe for cheaper dinners.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Indeed Brits are so down on their living standards that any change to the upside may carry political rewards, reckons Christabel Cooper of Labour Together, a think-tank close to the government. In surveys, it presented voters with official forecasts that project electricity prices to fall markedly over the next three years. Some responded with disbelief, says Ms Cooper: “People say, ‘All this seems too good to be true, I can’t imagine those prices being like that in 2028.’”&nbsp;But in energy prices, like so much else, Sir Keir’s fortunes are hostage to forces beyond his control. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in&nbsp;Britain,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty\">sign up</a>&nbsp;to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/15/cheap-petrol-offers-a-small-respite-for-squeezed-households\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Then we got the new bridge, that was 100 million.” Not bad for a seaside town with fewer than 70,000 inhabitants. However you slice it, the local councillor concludes, Yarmouth (as locals call it) astutely navigated the post-Brexit years, when successive governments had a rush of enthusiasm for getting cash to “left-behind” parts of the country.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Yarmouth’s screeching seagulls, blaring funfairs and faded air of Edwardian grandeur epitomise what is now a well-worn trope in British politics. Herring and the medieval wool trade made the town rich. Victorian holidaymakers flocked to its sandy beaches. Many still come, but the go-go years are over—package-deal holidays to the Mediterranean saw to that. Oil and, lately, offshore wind have helped, but not quite enough.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">So when the Brexit vote came in 2016, the result wasn’t close. Yarmouth voted to leave the European Union by more than 70%. The pro-Brexit <small>UK</small> Independence Party (<small>UKIP</small>) was already winning council seats back in 2009. If the past few Conservative governments have had one goal in the post-Brexit years, it was to win back places like Yarmouth.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Hence the cash. A visitor can drive in across the Herring Bridge, a £120m ($160m) bit of congestion relief that opened last year. Wandering into the town centre, they might walk past The Place, a £17m library and “learning hub” that opened this week, then buy a kebab from the market piazza, refurbished for £6m. By the beach the glass-and-iron Winter Gardens, a derelict Victorian greenhouse, sticks out on the horizon. A £16m renovation is due to finish in 2027.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The typical critique of “levelling-up”, the label that Boris Johnson’s government used for plans to spend big on worse-off parts of Britain, was that it was never really tried: too little money got set aside to make a difference. In that respect, Yarmouth is an exception. But the town still turfed out the Conservatives at the last general election in favour of Reform <small>UK</small>, a successor to <small>UKIP</small>.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Sir Brandon Lewis, the old <small>MP</small>, says the explanation is simple. “We made a big commitment on immigration and just didn’t do it.” No matter that Yarmouth managed, unusually, to win a high-court injunction against housing asylum-seekers, on the basis that doing so would damage tourism. The national narrative, he says, was simply too unpopular. “I don’t think the 2024 election reflects what was done locally.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Now Labour is mulling another big round of funding for projects in Reform-leaning areas. Yarmouth’s seafront might be worth a visit first, before too many grandiose ambitions take hold. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in&nbsp;Britain,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty\">sign up</a>&nbsp;to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/15/when-levelling-up-comes-to-town\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The thoroughfare is thronging with inebriated revellers, some stumbling semi-naked, others dancing and singing, venturing from one bar to the next. Nearby Caroline Street (aka “Chippy Lane”) is strewn with drunkards and discarded kebabs. But the alcohol-fuelled violence often associated with British nightlife is absent.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Data recently published by Cardiff University corroborate this observation. Over the last 25 years the annual number of Brits seeking treatment in hospitals for violence-related injuries has fallen from 450,000 to 150,000.  Thank better policing and changing social norms.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Jonathan Shepherd, the founder of Cardiff University’s Violence Research Group, emphasises prevention. As a young doctor in the 1980s he noticed the abundance of patients arriving in hospital at the weekend with lacerations. His research led to toughened glass becoming mandatory in bars and pubs, so that drinking vessels did not produce shards when they shattered. “Weapon use is strongly linked to weapon availability”, he says, “[drunk] people will use whatever is at hand” (see chart 1).</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_BRC266.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Photograph: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Police statistics undercount violent behaviour, as many assaults are not reported. Professor Shepherd realised that hospital attendances would provide a more complete picture. So 25 years ago Cardiff University set about collecting such data nationally. The latest annual figures, for 2024, were collected from 189 accident-and-emergency departments and other treatment centres across England and Wales.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Some local police forces use the anonymised hospital data to target crime hotspots. South Wales Police began doing so in the mid-2000s. They found that employing better data, at a cost of £200,000 ($360,000) a year, led to a 42% drop in violent injuries in Cardiff, saving £3m in health and criminal-justice costs. The technique, now known as the “Cardiff model” for violence prevention, has since been employed in 16 American cities, too. </p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"703\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC267.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The Welsh capital—which has the highest density of licensed drinking places in Britain—shows how revelry can be made safer. On Friday and Saturday nights the authorities operate “Cardiff After Dark”: St Mary Street is closed to traffic; bouncers share intel on troublemakers; <small>CCTV</small> is monitored and bobbies are on patrol. The police typically issue half a dozen “Section 34” notices each night for misdemeanours such as public urination, forcing perpetrators to leave the area for up to 48 hours or face arrest. Inspector Adrian Snook of South Wales Police says this ensures that “minor anti-social behaviour at 9pm does not become grievous bodily harm at 3am.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Beyond Cardiff, the data show, violence has fallen across the board in England and Wales. The number of men seeking treatment for injuries on Sundays—after getting into scraps on Saturday night—has declined by 55% over the past decade (see chart 2). Violence inflicted on young women has fallen by 42% over the same period and by 21% among men aged between 31 and 50 (see chart 3).</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"892\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_EPC269.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But the biggest fall has been among young men. <i>The Economist</i>’s analysis of the data finds that 65% of the decline in violence over the past decade is due to men aged 18-30 getting into fewer scrapes. Less alcohol is likely to be the main reason: the share of 16- to 24-year-olds who say they do not drink has increased from 18% to 28% in 11 years. Nerys Thomas from the College of Policing, a think-tank, says that preventative policing has coincided with a new generation of sensible drinkers.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">It is not all good news. Social media may result in angry men acting violently in the digital realm rather than on the street. And the number of people treated in hospitals for assaults caused by sharp objects (ie, knives) has stubbornly flatlined over the past decade, at 4,000 incidents a year. To help tackle knife crime, the government has funded 20 “violence reduction units” in big cities which are employing many of the Cardiff model’s techniques.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Writing in “The Better Angels of Our Nature”, Steven Pinker, a psychologist at Harvard University, argued that, over millennia, humanity has become “less violent, more empathetic and more peaceful”. Remarkably, that appears to be true in a single generation, too.

The sight is not exactly spectacular. Behind a fence in the city centre, a small team of workers have constructed a short tram line. The tracks begin abruptly outside an estate agent, run gently downhill, turn a corner, then stop after a mere 220 metres. But the humdrum nature of the project is the exciting thing about it.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Coventry had a tram network in the early 20th century. The tracks were damaged by heavy bombing in the second world war, and the city (which now has a population of 345,000) decided that buses and cars were better. Many other cities in Britain and continental Europe made the same decision. The last tram ran along London’s pre-war network back in 1952. The journey took three hours longer than usual, such were the crowds.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Since the 1990s new tram lines have been built in the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and London, among other places. Buses are cheaper and more flexible, but the fixed nature of tram tracks can actually be an advantage. The glint of steel in tarmac is likely to reassure residents and businesses that a route will endure.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Britain has been exceedingly bad at building this kind of infrastructure.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Creating a tram track normally involves digging a trench at least half a metre deep and filling it with concrete. Do that in an old city centre, and you are highly likely to hit gas and water pipes, among other things. Contractors in Edinburgh unearthed many pipes and underground structures that were on no plans, as well as a medieval graveyard. That tram project ran well over budget and behind schedule, turning into “hell on wheels”, in the words of an executive.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In Britain tram developers are responsible for moving utility pipes, and must pay almost the entire cost of doing so. That hugely pushes up the cost of construction. Ben Hopkinson of Britain Remade, a think-tank focused on infrastructure, estimates that British tram lines cost more than twice as much per kilometre as Dutch ones and more than three times as much as German ones.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Coventry is trying something different. Instead of digging a deep trench, contractors have scraped away about 30cm of road surface. Thin slabs of ultra-high-performance concrete are positioned on the ground, and the gaps under them filled with a concrete screed. Rails, which are about 15cm deep, are attached to the concrete slabs, then tarmac is added to bring the road surface up to the level of the rails.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">By any standard, but especially a British one, the truncated track has been built incredibly quickly. The city’s cabinet approved it in January; road scraping began in mid-March; by mid-April the rails were attached. The work has been carried out by a single construction crew, which was unfamiliar with the new method. “We have not tried to do this in Formula One style,” says Christopher Micallef, an engineer who is involved with the project.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Beginning on May 28th, members of the public will be able to ride up and down the track in a small new tram, which is innovative in its own way. Thanks to special bogies (the parts to which the wheels are attached) the tram can go around tight bends without screeching. It promises to be among the world’s briefest, least exciting journeys. Yet as <i>The Economist</i> went to press, every seat had been booked.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Coventry is not about to rebuild its pre-war tram network. But if it demonstrates that a line can be built quickly and cheaply, the city could benefit anyway. The council owns much of the technology, and could license it. When it comes to infrastructure, shallowness is a virtue. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in&nbsp;Britain,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty\">sign up</a>&nbsp;to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/15/how-to-build-tram-lines-quickly-and-cheaply\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

At the pub, the golf club and at least one church fete, he talked to everyone with such ease and understanding.” In his autobiography, Mr Farage recalls conjuring this scene while prone in hospital after a Volkswagen Beetle left the then 21-year-old crumpled like a “sort of fractured swastika”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">If Mr Farage is obsessed with death, it is because death is obsessed with him. The car crash was only the first of three near-misses, about which he speaks and writes often. A few weeks after the plaster from the crash was removed, one of his testicles swelled to the size of a tangerine or lemon (accounts vary) because of cancer. A quarter of a century later, a plane carrying Mr Farage smashed into English soil at about 80mph, leaving him inches from non-existence.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Four decades after his imagined funeral, the question of Mr Farage’s mortality is the subtext <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/04/24/the-man-britain-cannot-ignore\">of every other conversation in Westminster</a>. Reform <small>uk</small> sits atop the polls after <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/02/the-fallout-from-reform-uks-big-win-in-local-elections\">local elections</a> demonstrated the party is a potentially lethal threat to the Tories and Labour. Yet without its leader, the party is nothing. So politics has been reduced to a medieval court discussing rumours about the health of an elderly pretender. Mr Farage is only 61, but trades on his love of a smoke and a drink. It is a miracle he is still alive. British politics hinges on how&nbsp;long&nbsp;his death-defying luck lasts.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">It may seem crass to ponder Mr Farage’s mortality. No one does it more than he does. At times, it is with bravado. “They laid this paragon in the graveyard and returned to the City to get very drunk in my memory,” he wrote of his funeral. Beneath the banter, Mr Farage has been shaped by terrifying experiences. “I’m scared, I’m scared, I’m scared,” he said, hanging upside down from a mangled single-engine Wilga-35<small>A</small>, aviation fuel soaking his clothes. “Just get me out of this fucking thing.” Nearly dying made him more of a risk-taker, he writes in his autobiography. Mr Farage’s career is a series of preposterous gambles that eventually pay off.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Some in Westminster discuss a world without Mr Farage out of desperation. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives know how to deal with him politically. Each offers a similar slogan: “Nigel Farage is right—don’t vote for him.” Only the Liberal Democrats seem happy to take him on directly.&nbsp;And so Labour and Tory <small>mp</small>s hope instead that the universe will deal with him. If politics is impossible, then fate must intervene.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">British politics is often contingent. “He’s fat, he’s 53, he’s had a heart attack and he’s taking on a stress-loaded job,” wrote the<i> Sun </i>when John Smith became leader of the Labour Party in 1992, in a piece wondering whether the then leader of the opposition would qualify for life insurance. Two years on, Smith had a heart attack and died. Sir Tony Blair took over and won three elections. Sometimes actuarial tables are a better guide than polling tables.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">A world without Mr Farage is a world without Reform. The party is an odd set-up: there is Mr Farage and there are millions of voters. There is still, for all its attempts to professionalise itself, little in between. Should Mr Farage be hit by a proverbial bus, there is no clear successor. Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, a businessman who bankrolled the party at times, is a wallet with a haircut.&nbsp;To voters, Reform is a one-man band.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Perhaps Mr Farage is simply irreplaceable. His is a shtick honed in pubs and half-empty village halls over decades, as he dragged the idea of Britain’s departure from the <small>eu</small> out of the fringe and into the mainstream. As head of the <small>uk</small> Independence Party, he led a strange band of politicians to victory in a national election in 2014 (for seats in the European Parliament), helping guarantee an in-out vote on Europe. Mr Farage repeated the feat in 2019 while leading the Brexit Party (as Reform was known), helping guarantee the hardest possible Brexit. A missed scan here, a few inches there and none of it would have happened.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Hints of a Nigel-less world are painful for Reformers. Staff grumble about pictures that show the effects of Mr Farage’s bibulousness and bad luck. When a woman hurled a milkshake at him in 2024, Mr Farage wanted jail time. The plane crash left him with near-crippling back pain. A phalanx of burly men surround Mr Farage wherever he goes to protect him from being buffeted, as much as from being shot. In British politics, the image of someone carrying a Ming vase is a common metaphor. Usually, the vase refers to a delicate political consensus. In the case of Reform, it is Mr Farage himself.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Rivals may think that the demise of Mr Farage would lead to political salvation. What comes next could well be worse. Mr Farage has been successful because he knows, more or less, where to draw the line. In the European Parliament he refused to deal with out-and-out fascists. In his own telling, he is a one-man <i>cordon sanitaire</i>. Reform would, most likely, wither without him. But the demand for something new—and perhaps nastier—on the right would remain.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">The man who fell to Earth</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">“Who knows what heights he might have attained had he lived?” said the imaginary vicar when Mr Farage wrote the eulogy for his 21-year-old self. Four decades on Mr Farage has reached higher than he could have imagined. Britain is out of the<small> EU</small>, thanks in no small part to his efforts. No one else has led not one but two insurgent parties to victories in national elections. Now he stands on the brink of something bigger. A once-in-a-century shift, with the death of the Conservative Party and the rise of Reform, is possible. If Mr Farage goes, this future goes with him and the same eulogy would be delivered today.&nbsp;<span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in&nbsp;Britain,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty\">sign up</a>&nbsp;to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/14/a-world-without-nigel-farage\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The catch, as reported by Forbidden Stories, a network of investigative journalists, was that African Initiative is run by Russian intelligence.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Many Western countries are winding down their efforts to broadcast to the world. In March President Donald Trump pulled funding for Voice of America and its sister networks, and dismantled <small>USAID</small>, which funded thousands of journalists around the world. Public broadcasters’ budgets have been trimmed everywhere from Australia to Canada and France.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">A battle of ideas is under way. As Western countries quieten down, others are speaking up. China and Russia are investing hundreds of millions or possibly billions on disinformation, Tim Davie, the director-general of the <small>BBC</small>, reportedly said on May 14th. “The future of&nbsp;our cohesive,&nbsp;democratic society feels, for the first time in my life, at risk,” he said in a speech. He called for increased funding to double the reach of the <small>BBC</small>’s World Service </p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Eighteen months ago <small>RT</small>, Russia’s state-controlled news network, launched a bold advertising campaign in countries including Mexico, India, Serbia and Tunisia. “Why won’t Britain return the Koh-i-Noor diamond?” asked an <small>RT</small> ad on the front page of the <i>Times of India</i>. Last year it opened the <small>RT</small> Academy, which trains journalists in Africa, South-East Asia and China. Sputnik, another state-run Russian news organisation, recently launched an Africa service. <small>RT</small> and Sputnik have been expanding in Latin America, where they share producers, camera crew and office space with Venezuela’s Telesur and Iran’s Hispan<small>TV</small>, according to Emanuele Ottolenghi of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, an American think-tank.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Smaller countries are distributing news around the world, too. Turkey’s state-run <small>TRT</small> news network launched an Africa service in 2023, opening a Somali-language branch in March. It has been hiring former <small>BBC</small> staff, according to an ex-<small>BBC</small> reporter. Besides promoting Turkey’s good deeds in Africa, where it invests in infrastructure and exporters arms, <small>TRT</small> delights in poking fun at former colonial powers.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The biggest investment in foreign journalistic operations seems to have been made by China. Xinhua, a state-run news agency, has increased its Africa bureaus from a “handful” two decades ago to 37 last year, according to the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies (<small>ACSS</small>), a think-tank within America’s defence department. Like Russia, it also offers training and scholarships to journalists: the China Africa Press Centre flies African reporters out to Chinese media outlets for ten-month assignments to absorb their newsroom culture. StarTimes, a Chinese firm, is now the second-largest digital-<small>TV</small> service in Africa.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"703\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_IRC327.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Chinese news is especially strong on social media. While American congressmen fret about TikTok, China appears to be relying on Facebook, an American social network, to spread its message internationally. The most-followed news organisation on Facebook is not <small>CNN</small> or the <i>New York Times</i>, but <small>CGTN</small>, China’s state-run <small>TV</small> network, which with 125m followers is just ahead of Shakira, a pop star. Despite the fact that Facebook is banned in China itself, the five most-followed news organisations on Facebook are all Chinese, disseminating news in English (see chart).</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The Chinese organisations appear to have bought much of their reach using Facebook advertising. None of them is anything like as popular on other social networks. (On YouTube, for instance, the top four news channels are all Indian; on TikTok, the most-followed news account is Britain’s <i>Daily Mail</i>, followed by Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya.) Facebook’s ad library reveals a sophisticated operation, with Chinese outlets trying out multiple ads before pouring dollars into the most effective. Some ads are innocuous clickbait, showing off Chinese tourist hotspots. Others are politically charged: last year Xinhua paid Facebook to boost a story implying that Filipino fishermen in disputed waters were spies, with the hashtag #fishyfishermen.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Does this kind of promotion count for much? A study in the Harvard Misinformation Review examined nearly 1,000 Facebook ads bought by Chinese state media in 2018-20, which were seen 655m times, mainly outside the rich world. The authors, Arjun Tambe and Toni Friedman, found that when a country saw more of these ads, its media produced more positive coverage of China—for instance, dubbing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong “riots”. With exposure to more ads came more pro-Chinese coverage of subjects including covid-19 and China’s economy.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">As well as distributing news under their own brand, countries are doing deals to insert their stories into local titles, which are often grateful for cheap content. Xinhua has an agreement with Kenya’s Nation Media Group, giving it access to that firm’s eight radio and <small>TV</small> stations, 28m social-media followers and 90,000 daily-newspaper readers in four African countries, according to the <small>ACSS</small>. <small>RT</small> reportedly has contracts with more than 30 African <small>TV</small> stations to broadcast its content. Russia is particularly keen on this kind of “narrative laundering”, in the words of Victor Ilie of Snoop, a news site in Romania. As audiences grow suspicious of outlets like Sputnik, Russia is increasingly co-opting influencers. Romania’s presidential election was cancelled in December after its security agencies claimed to have uncovered a Russia-led influence operation on TikTok; in a re-run this month another pro-Russia candidate came first.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Western countries still have loud megaphones. On YouTube, the <small>BBC</small>’s Hindi-language channel has more followers than its English one; on Facebook its Burmese-language page has more followers than Fox News. And despite dwindling resources, independent journalists in contested regions are carrying on. Ziarul de Garda, a Moldovan outlet, has lost 40% of its salary budget since America stopped funding donors. Yet its boss, Alina Radu, is determined: “We have a rule in our newsroom. Russia never gets relaxed about Moldova. So we have to never get relaxed as well.” <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2025/05/15/china-and-russia-are-deploying-powerful-new-weapons-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

YouTube removed more than half a million channels last year for broadcasting misinformation. Facebook and Instagram deleted 27m falsehoods about covid-19 at the height of the pandemic. The doughty fact-checking organisations that try to keep the internet honest face more claims than they can handle. How should they prioritise?</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The question is growing more pressing as fact-checking resources become scarcer. Meta, which built probably the world’s largest network of fact-checkers for its social networks, announced in January that it would start to replace professional sleuths with volunteers. America’s government is dismantling <small>USAID</small>, which had channelled funds to fact-checking organisations.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">So checkers came up with a new approach: forecasting which claims are most dangerous and thus which most deserve to be put under the microscope. Researchers from the University of Westminster and fact-checkers from Full Fact, Africa Check and the <small>AFP</small> news agency developed a triaging system to sort weapons-grade misinformation from everyday nonsense.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">One test of a false claim is whether enough people will believe it for it to cause any harm. To swing an election with misinformation, you need to persuade many people; to kill someone with fake medicine you need to convince only one. Another test is whether those believing a false claim have the capacity to act on it. People may be misled about the genesis of covid-19, for example, but whether they think it came from a market or a lab is unlikely to change their behaviour. The researchers estimated that, of the false claims in their sample, 57% were unlikely to contribute to any specific real-world effect.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Of the remaining, potentially consequential falsehoods, the checkers considered whether the consequence would be “direct”—such as persuading people not to take a vaccine—or “cumulative”, contributing to a false narrative about immigration, say. The claims were roughly evenly split. “Cumulative” harm is harder to assess, says Peter Cunliffe-Jones of the University of Westminster, but large data sets make it possible to see how often a claim is repeated, and thus when a narrative is forming.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Triaging may help overworked fact-checkers to focus on the most dangerous false claims. But harm is not everything. Karl Malakunas of <small>AFP </small>points out that one of his organisation’s most-read fact-checks concerns a photograph of an elephant carrying a lion cub in its trunk (fake, alas). It seems most unlikely that anyone fooled by it would seek a pachyderm playmate. But correcting viral falsehoods matters for digital literacy, Mr Malakunas says.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Time devoted to selecting which dodgy claims to check is probably well spent. It takes five minutes to triage a claim, whereas carrying out a thorough check takes five to six hours. The fact-checking world needs to get more systematic in its approach, says Mr Cunliffe-Jones. “If this community is going to learn anything from Meta…it’s that data is the future.” <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2025/05/15/fact-checkers-forecast-which-dodgy-claims-will-do-most-damage\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Even as Mr Trump began a business-focused tour of Arab states on May 13th, geopolitical disputes on several continents had a claim on his attention. In the few days before he flew to the Middle East, Mr Trump suggested that he is just the man to end conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza, halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions and broker a solution to India and Pakistan’s decades-old contest over Kashmir. For good measure, he hailed a 90-day pause of the highest <small>US</small>-China tariffs as great for “unification and peace”. Alas, that promptly set nerves a-jangling in Taiwan, since “peaceful reunification” is China’s euphemism for conquering that democratic island.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">On the face of it, this frenetic diplomacy might seem hard to square with Mr Trump’s long-standing disdain for interventionism, and for predecessors who sought to use American power for nation-building in far-off places. During his first presidency in 2019, Mr Trump told world leaders gathered for the <small>UN </small>General Assembly in New York that “the future does not belong to globalists“ but to “patriots” who pursue their national interests without shame and respect the differences that make each country unique.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In the second Trump era, ambitions to tackle global crises might seem to sit uncomfortably with the world-weary instincts of many in his inner circle. Old-school Reagan Republicans, committed to defending allies and deterring adversaries, have lost ground to “restrainers” who seek to avoid foreign entanglements. The restrainers include Vice-President J<small>.</small>D. Vance, whose initial public response when violence broke out between India and Pakistan was to declare the conflict “fundamentally none of our business”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr Trump is appalled by lives lost in war, seeing many conflicts as simply incomprehensible. At times he seems moved by arguments as old as America itself, depicting the country as a new Eden providentially set on its own continent, far from Europe’s ancient hatreds and grudges. In February Mr Trump asserted that the war in Ukraine matters far more to Europe than it does to America, which has “a big, beautiful Ocean as separation”. He could have been quoting America Firsters of the 1930s, campaigning to keep out of a war with Germany.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Actually, Mr Trump’s dealmaking zeal has its own logic. He is not a traditional isolationist. In part, that is because since the 1930s mankind has invented weapons, notably nuclear ones, that threaten the whole planet. The Trump administration’s insouciance about India-Pakistan clashes crumbled at the first hints that each side might target or use their respective nuclear arsenals.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In part, Mr Trump is too proud of his dealmaking prowess to forswear chances to show it off. That surely explains his proposal to help India and Pakistan resolve disagreements over Kashmir, appalling Indian officials who seek no international mediation of that dispute. Nor is he a pacifist. Rather he is a leader who seeks to intimidate foes with bluster and shows of military might, or with targeted strikes that avoid the need for all-out war.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Most importantly, the president and his inner circle—especially his most-trusted diplomatic envoy, a New York property developer, Steve Witkoff—do subscribe to a global value system. That universal value is money. Mr Trump is a globalist of a particular kind. He has no illusions about the brotherhood of man. Instead, he trusts in the solidarity that binds powerful individuals in a position to enrich themselves and one another. Evidence abounds of his belief that this globalism of greed can resolve even tangled disputes, for a price. Time and again, Trumpian statecraft follows the same playbook, seemingly adapted from Mr Trump’s years as a builder of hotels and other shiny properties. First, Mr Trump stokes or allows tensions to reach a crisis point. Then he suggests compromises that offer doses of pain and of economic profit to each side. Praising his own efforts to calm India and Pakistan, he boasted that he told the two governments: “If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade.” This is a brilliant innovation, he suggested: “People never really use trade the way I use it.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">A long interview that Mr Witkoff gave in March to Tucker Carlson, a conservative pundit, is regarded as an authentic glimpse of Mr Trump’s worldview by a Washington insider. Asked about his diplomatic missions, Mr Witkoff offers an unvarying reply: peace would be profitable, and is thus “logical”. Hamas leaders are not “ideologically intractable”, he suggests, but want better lives for Gazan children. Iran once had a “wonderful economy” and could do so again. Russia could work with America on energy deals and on shared Arctic shipping lanes.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">The survival instinct beats greed</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Sceptics may counter that Trumpian globalism is shockingly incurious about ideological and sectarian enmities that underpin many disputes. Mr Trump struggles to understand those moved to sacrifice by great causes, calling American war dead “losers”. At times, Mr Trump looks frankly naive, as when he showed a film to the North Korean despot, Kim Jong Un, depicting beach resorts North Korea could build if it abandoned nuclear weapons. Mr Kim, a man who had his own uncle and (allegedly) his half-brother killed to preserve his grip on power, was not swayed.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Other governments, at least, understand Mr Trump. Arab rulers have offered Trump-family businesses property and cryptocurrency investments worth billions. Qatar wants to give a Boeing 747 to serve as Air Force One. The Democratic Republic of Congo has offered America mineral rights in exchange for security support, inspired by a deal imposed on Ukraine. Syria’s interim ruler suggests Damascus as the site for a new Trump Tower. For his pains, Mr Trump is said to covet a Nobel peace prize. For an America First president, that is a revealingly globalist bauble. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/opinion\">Opinion newsletter</a>, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2025/05/13/why-donald-trump-is-a-globalist\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Back then Walmart warehouses were small, noisy, chaotic places. Staff hauled crates off trailers and sorted items by hand.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">How things have changed. The newest Walmart warehouses are vast hangars filled with conveyor belts, computer screens and robotic arms that silently pick and pack products. Artificial-intelligence (<small>AI</small>) tools ensure pallets are loaded onto trucks in such a way that they can be unloaded in stores with ease: fragile items at the top, urgent products at the front and things that go in the same aisle together. A few people lend the machinery a hand. If it sounds familiar—a lot like one Seattle-based tech giant—it should.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">When Mr McMillon was appointed chief executive just over a decade ago Walmart was in peril. Amazon, an online bookseller turned “everything store”, was upending retail. Its endless variety and doorstep delivery made Walmart’s vast out-of-town stores seem like relics of a bygone age. Walmart’s same-store sales were in decline; profits were cratering.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Today, however, the retail colossus is resurgent. With $680bn in revenue last year and 2.1m workers, it is the largest company in the world on both measures. In America it takes in a tenth of all retail spending, excluding cars, and a quarter of the outlay on groceries. Mr McMillon has reinvigorated the company by reinvesting profits into new technologies while using its bricks-and-mortar infrastructure to beat Amazon at its own game.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC372.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Investors have rewarded Walmart handsomely. In the past year its market capitalisation has soared by over 50%, to more than $750bn. At nearly 40 times earnings, it is now valued at a higher multiple than Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft (see chart 1). In its quarterly results on May 15th Walmart reaffirmed that it expects its sales this year to grow at a comfortable rate of 3-4%, with operating profits rising faster still, even as Donald Trump’s chaotic trade war disrupts global supply chains and squeezes other retailers. Can anything hold the giant back?</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In 1962 Sam Walton—a trucker-capped, pickup-driving penny-pincher—founded Walmart as a general-merchandise retailer with a business model based around a simple flywheel. Keep costs low, pass savings on to customers, win market share, harness scale to further lower costs—and listen as the cash registers sing. Over time it added groceries and opened vast supercentres, where shoppers could buy everything from guns to butter, pick up prescriptions at a pharmacy and get their tyres checked at a garage. As Carl Mela of Duke University puts it, Walmart was “the original everything store”.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Today the company is spinning a new flywheel, centred on e-commerce. Dan Bartlett, Walmart’s corporate-affairs chief, admits that it “missed the first wave of e-commerce” around the turn of the millennium. Its strength has always been its physical footprint. Walmart has some 5,000 stores across America; 90% of Americans live within ten miles (16km) of one.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr McMillon has put that infrastructure to work to boost online sales. Supercentres, which on average stock 120,000 discrete products, have been turned into distribution hubs. Warehouses built to serve shops now deal with online orders, too. With a third-party marketplace much like Amazon’s, Walmart has expanded its online range to hundreds of millions of products. As well as handing the retailer a cut of sales, many merchants on the platform pay extra to use its logistics network. Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons Walmart takes 12% of third-party sales plus an average 8% for storage, packing and delivery.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">A new spark</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Walmart’s American e-commerce unit made over $100bn in sales last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm (see chart 2). Although it remains a distant second to Amazon, with $480bn of e-commerce sales in America in 2024, Walmart is gaining ground: its online sales are growing at around 20% a year, twice as fast as its rival’s. In the tricky category of grocery deliveries—which require a temperature-controlled supply chain and speedy distribution—it already has the lead.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC369.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">E-commerce has also opened up new revenue streams. Walmart has an Amazon-Prime-like membership programme, called Walmart+, which provides customers in America with perks including free delivery for $8.17 per month. Combined with Sam’s Club, its answer to Costco’s members-only stores, Walmart made $3.8bn from membership programmes in 2024, double the figure five years earlier.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Meanwhile, the trove of proprietary data Walmart collects through e-commerce allows it to target ads at shoppers and check whether they buy what is marketed to them. Suresh Kumar, the firm’s chief technologist, calls it “closing the loop”. Walmart has lined its shops with screens playing ads. The Walmart app is plastered with them, too. And Walmart’s recent acquisition of Vizio, a maker of smart televisions, means that the company can also show viewers ads on <small>tv</small>.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All told, Walmart’s advertising unit generated $4.4bn in revenue in 2024, up almost 30% on the previous year. That is fun-sized compared with the rest of its business. But given the operating margin on ad sales is around 70%, Morgan Stanley reckons they made up 10% of Walmart’s operating profit last year, and will account for 16% by 2027.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-3\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Walmart has been pouring its profits back into its reinvention. The retailer was once a pioneer in deploying new technologies. When computers began to transform business in the late 1960s Walton signed up to a computer class at <small>IBM</small>. Shortly after that his company set up the largest private-satellite system in the country to connect its stores. Today it is spending big to make up for lost time in e-commerce. Its capital expenditure has doubled since 2019, reaching $24bn last year, equivalent to two-thirds of its operating cashflow. The retailer is now training up Sparky, an <small>AI</small> assistant that helps customers find products, and Wally, which helps its merchandising teams choose items to sell. “Everything is going in one direction for them,” says Robert Ohmes of Bank of America. “The flywheel is turning faster and faster.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Where does growth come from next? With its promise of “everyday low prices”, Walmart has long been the retailer of choice for low- and middle-income Americans. Now it is trying to woo wealthier consumers. It has launched a premium food label, Bettergoods, which offers items like French macarons and olive-oil crackers that wouldn’t be out of place in a high-end grocer like Whole Foods. Shoppers can now find second-hand designer handbags on Walmart’s marketplace. The firm has been remodelling hundreds of its dingiest stores every year. And for those who still wouldn’t be seen dead in one of them, its online options are more convenient than ever.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Walmart is also looking abroad. Its strategy has been to experiment with different business models in different markets without fear of pulling out if need be. Walmart de México is the most-valuable firm on the local stockmarket; in China a Sam’s Club membership is seen as a ticket to the aspirational middle-class. In both countries Walmart is considered far more premium than it is at home. In India Walmart majority-owns Flipkart, an online marketplace, and PhonePe, a payments app. Since 2021, when it sold off businesses in Argentina, Britain and Japan, Walmart’s international division has been growing speedily. It expects to double its sales and operating profit between 2024 and 2028.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Made in America</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Walmart now confronts another disruptive force: the man behind the Resolute Desk. The retailer has been doing its best to ingratiate itself with Mr Trump since his return to the presidency. Mr McMillon was one of the few bosses who attended the presidential-inauguration ceremony in January, and has called on Mr Trump both at his Mar-a-Lago resort and the White House. In November Walmart said it was rolling back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid Mr Trump’s crusade against wokeness. It has also said it will miss its 2030 target for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr Trump’s trade war has put Walmart in a delicate position, given its importance to American consumers. Its executives have been back and forth between the company’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and Washington sharing real-time data with officials on prices and shopping behaviour to help inform policy. “This situation that we’re in today is very fluid,” says John Furner, head of Walmart’s business in America, diplomatically.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Tariffs may not be as much of a problem for the company as it would seem at first glance. Walmart has certainly benefited from cheap imports. Roughly a third of the products it currently sells in America are made or grown outside the country, largely in China, Mexico or Canada. Some of these Walmart has procured directly from foreign suppliers; others come from American firms that have offshored production in response to pressure from the retailer to lower prices.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Yet Walmart seems better placed to weather Mr Trump’s tariff storm than most of its competitors. It has already made progress diversifying its supply chain away from China over the past few years, observes Zhihan Ma of Bernstein, a broker. It has, for instance, been sourcing a greater share of its products from India. The retailer has been expanding its domestic supply chain, too. Take children’s car seats, most of which are made in China. In October, in anticipation of Mr Trump’s election, the company signed deals to secure much of America’s manufacturing capacity, according to Ms Ma.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Walmart’s heft also allows it to shift much of the burden of tariffs onto suppliers. Before the recent trade truce with China, which has resulted in American tariffs being lowered to 30% for 90 days, Bernstein estimated that new import duties were on course to raise the cost of products sold at Walmart by an average of 5.2%. Suppliers, it reckoned, would absorb half of that, with the average sticker price in Walmart stores rising by 2.6% to make up the balance. Sales volumes would drop by 2% in response, giving revenue a net boost of around half a percent. For most other big retailers, by contrast, Bernstein predicted a decline in sales. Walmart’s product mix helps: groceries, demand for which is less sensitive to price movements, account for three-fifths of its sales in America. That compares with one-fifth for Target, a bricks-and-mortar rival, and a sliver for Amazon.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Indeed, as Americans start to feel the pinch, Walmart’s lower prices may help it win over yet more customers. Research by JPMorgan Chase, another bank, suggests that it is typically 4-5% cheaper than Target and 8-10% cheaper than other grocers. Walmart will use that to its advantage. At a meeting with Wall Street analysts in April Mr McMillon said that the retailer plans to “play offence”. “Manager’s special” signs are already popping up around its stores, advertising discounts.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-4\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">And what of Amazon? Over the past decade it has sought to become more like Walmart, purchasing Whole Foods in 2017 to expand its grocery business and experimenting with various types of physical stores. The effort has been a disappointment. A technology it pioneered to monitor customers as they pick items from shelves and charge them as they walk out has failed to entice the masses into its shops. Walmart may soon have little left to learn from the disrupter. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line\">Bottom Line</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/15/how-walmart-became-a-tech-giant-and-took-over-the-world\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

During the campaign Mr Trump positioned himself as the oil industry’s only hope against the supposedly hydrocarbon-hating Democrats—brushing aside the fact that domestic oil production rose sharply during Joe Biden’s time in office. Mr Trump has since set about rolling back environmental rules and expedited permitting in an effort to get America’s oilmen to “drill, baby, drill”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">With his trade war, however, the president has also trampled on global demand for hydrocarbons. Since he returned to the Oval Office the benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil price has fallen from $80 a barrel to $60 (see chart 1). Some also speculate that Mr Trump’s noisy demands for a lower price contributed to a recent decision by the <small>OPEC</small> cartel to boost production, which it made ahead of the president’s visit to Saudi Arabia on May 13th and 14th. All this is a problem for the country’s shale patch, which accounts for two-thirds of domestic output—and for smaller producers in particular, who have been among the president’s most enthusiastic backers.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC325.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Today’s price is troublingly low for America’s shale drillers. Matthew Bernstein of Rystad, a consultancy, calculates that, on average, they need an oil price of around $63 a barrel to cover their production costs, overheads, debt interest and dividends. On May 5th Diamondback Energy, a shale firm, said that it was slashing its production target for the year and cutting capital spending by $400m. Others, including Coterra Energy, <small>EOG</small> Resources and Matador, have also announced plans to reduce drilling. “We are at a tipping point for <small>US</small> oil production,” says Travis Stice, Diamondback’s boss. “If these prices persist for a year, <small>US</small> oil production will decline,” warns Ben Dell of Kimmeridge, a private-equity firm focused on energy.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In addition to weighing on prices, Mr Trump’s tariffs are also raising costs for oil businesses. Tariffs on steel products such as drilling pipes, casings and tanks are of particular concern for the industry.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"778\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC324.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All this is especially worrying for smaller producers. Thanks to recent consolidation, oil giants such as <small>BP</small>, Chevron and ExxonMobil account for roughly 60% of American shale output, notes Scott Gruber of Citigroup, a bank. Smaller independent firms tend to have less productive wells and higher costs (see chart 2). Unlike the giants, they lack the bargaining power to force suppliers to absorb the impact of tariffs. Capital to help weather the storm tends to be harder to get—and costlier—and the smaller firms are typically not diversified beyond American shale. So far at least, <small>BP</small>, Chevron and Exxon have announced no plans to cut production.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The giants, however, are not enthused by the president’s proposal to axe his predecessor’s subsidies for carbon-capture and hydrogen technologies, which they have been investing in. Exxon recently said it would spend up to $30bn by 2030 on such low-carbon endeavours.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That contrasts with the support for Mr Trump among smaller oil firms. Their godfather is Harold Hamm, a shale billionaire from Oklahoma who backed the president’s campaign and persuaded Mr Trump to name Christopher Wright, a fellow shale driller, as America’s secretary of energy.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr Hamm recently convened a secret meeting of oilmen in Tulsa, supposedly to promote the use of natural gas to power data centres for artificial intelligence. Insiders say that plans were hatched to tilt the federal regulatory playing field to favour fossil fuels over renewables. Four members of the cabinet were reportedly present. Despite the pain brought on by Mr Trump’s trade war, little oil still has big hopes for his presidency. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line\">Bottom Line</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/11/donald-trump-is-throttling-americas-oil-industry\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Only a fifth of the country has a positive opinion of the industry, according to Gallup, a pollster—meaning its executives rank below even estate agents in the public’s esteem. The lofty prices of many drugs in America have created the impression of a greedy industry that exploits <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/05/12/the-medicaid-calculus-behind-donald-trumps-tax-cuts\">the sick</a>.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Donald Trump, at least in this respect, seems all too happy to follow convention. On May 12th the president signed an executive order that seeks to force drugmakers to reduce their prices in America to the lowest rate they charge in other rich countries. That adds to the consternation of pharma bosses already fretting about Mr Trump’s protectionism. Although drugs were excluded from the sweeping “reciprocal” <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/04/03/president-trumps-mindless-tariffs-will-cause-economic-havoc\">tariffs</a> announced on April 2nd, duties remain on the table. Executives warn that the combined effect would be to snarl supply chains, raise treatment costs and slow the development of new medicines.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Start with the president’s attempt to rein in prices. The executive order instructs his administration to “communicate price targets” to firms based on international benchmarks and establish a mechanism for patients to buy their drugs directly, bypassing the middlemen that pervade America’s convoluted health-care system. Companies that do not comply could face “aggressive measures”, though the order offers little detail on what these might be.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">There are many problems with the plan. For instance, it ignores the fact that generic drugs, which make up 90% of prescriptions in America by volume, cost a third less than in other rich countries, according to the<small> rand</small> Corporation, a think-tank.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"703\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC328.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">And although branded drugs are more than four times as pricey in America as in comparable markets, pegging prices to those abroad may not achieve the president’s aims. America is by far the biggest market for most drugmakers, accounting for around two-fifths of sales and two-thirds of profits for the industry (see chart). Rather than cutting prices there, many firms would raise them abroad and perhaps pull out of some countries altogether. Mr Trump’s policy would thus shrink their businesses while doing little to lower health-care costs in America.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That is supported by recent research. A study in 2022 by Pierre Dubois of the Toulouse School of Economics and co-authors simulated what would happen if America’s drug prices were benchmarked to those of Canada. They concluded that drugmakers would only modestly reduce prices in America—but sharply increase them in Canada. Another paper by Margaret Kyle of the École des Mines, in Paris, reaches a similar conclusion using evidence from European countries that tie their prices to those elsewhere.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">For now, the industry is taking comfort from the fact that the order faces many hurdles before it becomes reality. A similar proposal during Mr Trump’s first term was struck down in court, and drugmakers may challenge this effort, too. Moreover, the order is “plagued with implementation issues”, notes Melanie Whittington of <small>MEDA</small>Corp, a research firm. Enforcement will probably require congressional approval, which may not be forthcoming. Although some Republicans support the idea, Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, has said he is “not a big fan”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Such consolations do not apply when it comes to Mr Trump’s trade policies. On April 1st the administration launched an investigation into whether pharmaceutical imports threaten national security. If they are deemed to do so, tariffs could follow. The president has floated rates of between 25% and 200%.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That would be a pain for drugmakers. They rely on global supply chains that have been designed to cut not only production costs but taxes, too. Take the example of Keytruda, a cancer treatment from Merck, which is manufactured in Ireland. According to Jefferies, an investment bank, Merck holds the intellectual property (<small>IP</small>) for Keytruda in the Netherlands. The arrangement allows the firm to book profits at a tax rate of 10.5%, roughly half what it would pay if the <small>IP</small> resided in America.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Several big pharma firms are pledging to boost output in America in response to the tariff threat. Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to invest $55bn, Roche $50bn, Eli Lilly $27bn and Novartis $23bn over the next few years. But factories take time to build. David Ricks, Eli Lilly’s chief executive, warns that if tariffs are imposed, firms like his will take a hit to profits, as existing contracts with health insurers limit their ability to pass on higher costs.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All this could force firms to cut costs elsewhere, most likely in research and development, thus slowing the creation of new medicines and ultimately costing lives. Meanwhile, the production of generics, for which profit margins are thin, will not move from low-cost countries such as India, so tariffs will merely push up prices for Americans. Mr Trump’s policies may achieve little more than a giant headache for patients and drugmakers alike. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line\">Bottom Line</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/13/big-pharmas-jumbo-profits-are-under-threat-in-america\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Not Nvidia, it seems. On May 19th the chip-design firm will release the GeForce <small>RTX </small>5060, its newest mass-market graphics card for video gamers. <small>PR</small> departments at companies like <small>AMD</small> and Nvidia usually roll the pitch for such products by providing influential YouTubers and websites with samples to test ahead of time. That allows them to publish their reviews on launch day.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">This time, though, Nvidia seems to have got cold feet. Reviewers have said that it is withholding vital software until the day of the card’s launch, making timely coverage impossible. May 19th is also the day before the start of Computex, a big Taiwanese trade show that often saturates the tech press.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Trying to slip a product out without fanfare often means a company is worried it will not be well received. That may be the case with the 5060. Nvidia, which got its start in gaming, has more recently become a star of the artificial-intelligence (<small>AI</small>)<small> </small>business. But some of its early customers are feeling jilted. Reviews for some recent gaming products have been strikingly negative. Hardware Unboxed, a YouTube channel with more than 1m subscribers, described one recent graphics chip as a “piece of crap”. A video on another channel, Gamers Nexus (2.4m subscribers), complains about inflated performance claims and “marketing <small>BS</small>”. Linus Tech Tips (16.3m) opined in April that Nvidia is “grossly out of touch” with its customers.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Price is one reason for the grousing. Short supply means Nvidia’s products tend to be sold at a much higher price than the official rate. The 4060, which the 5060 is designed to replace, has a recommended price of $299. But on Newegg, a big online shop, the cheapest 4060 costs more than $400. The 5090, Nvidia’s top gaming card, is supposed to go for $1,999. Actually getting hold of one can cost $3,000 or more.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_WBC373.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Quality control seems to have slipped, too. Power cables in some of the firm’s high-end cards have been melting during use. In February Nvidia admitted that some cards had been sold with vital components missing (it offered free replacements). Reviewers complain about miserly hardware on the firm’s mid-range cards, such as the 5060, that leaves them struggling with some newer games.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In February Nvidia reported that quarterly revenue at its gaming division was down 11% year on year. Until recently that would have been a problem, as gaming accounted for the majority of the firm’s revenue. Now, though, the <small>AI</small> boom has made it a sideshow. Data-centre sales brought in $35.6bn last quarter, more than 90% of the total and up from just $3.6bn in the same period two years earlier (see chart). With that money fountain gushing, gamers can grumble as much as they like—but unless the firm’s <small>AI </small>business starts misfiring too, neither its bosses nor its shareholders are under much pressure to listen. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line\">Bottom Line</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/15/nvidias-original-customers-are-feeling-unloved-and-grumpy\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Alexander Fleming notices mould growing on a plate of bacteria and discovers penicillin. John Snow produces a map of the victims of a cholera outbreak in 19th-century London and traces the outbreak to a single water pump. A German chemist called August Kekulé falls asleep, dreams about snakes eating their tails and realises upon waking that the benzene molecule has the shape of a ring.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Moments like these make for good film scenes, but they are precisely the wrong way to think about corporate innovation. Firms make advances through sustained effort, the passage of time and teamwork. Take, for example, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2025/05/12/innovation-coming-up-with-new-ideas\">three stories of innovation</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/10/02/introducing-boss-class-from-the-economist\">new season of Boss Class</a>, our podcast on how to be a great manager.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Wayve, a self-driving software firm that is now one of Europe’s hottest artificial intelligence (<small>AI</small>) startups, was an outlier for years. Alex Kendall, a co-founder, was studying at Cambridge when he became convinced that the best way to solve the self-driving problem was to have an <small>AI</small> learn patterns of driving behaviour for itself.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That made him unusual. At the time the industry was trying to write rules for what a car should do when it encounters a specific situation. Wayve’s approach is much more orthodox now; last month the firm signed a deal with Nissan to be part of the Japanese carmaker’s autonomous-driving technology. But it’s been an eight-year effort to get there. “The biggest bullshit is eureka ideas where you just wake up and have an idea that solves things,” says Mr Kendall.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">A good idea can go nowhere if the circumstances are not right. By the same token, having tried something before is not a reason to ignore it in the future, as the case of Google shows. Liz Reid, its head of search, says that many of the tech giant’s successes were tried several times before they finally caught on. One example is reviews for restaurants on Google Maps, a feature that the team was sure would be useful but that initially asked too much of reviewers. The arrival of notifications and location data was crucial. Before then, you had to remember to write a review or indeed where you had been to eat. After that, Google’s knowledge that you had been to a specific restaurant, and its ability to prompt you to give a rating, made reviewing much simpler.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Finally, consider Monumental, a four-year-old Dutch startup that is trying to mechanise bricklaying using robots. It depends on constant feedback to improve. Salar al-Khafaji, a co-founder, sold his first startup to Palantir, a data-analytics giant; there he saw the practice of “forward deployment”, whereby Palantir’s developers work directly with customers to configure software to suit their needs. His new firm adopts a similar principle of getting out into the world.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Monumental acts as a subcontractor on construction jobs, using human masons to finish any work that its machines cannot do. Working on projects in this way gives the company both a flow of money and, even more usefully, information about all the problems it has yet to overcome. Building sites are messy, unstructured places, where things get moved, weather changes and lots of things can go wrong. Operators on the site note down every glitch and obstacle that the robots encounter in a shared “friction log”; engineers and coders at the firm’s headquarters in Amsterdam try to resolve them.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Companies achieve breakthroughs all the time. Dramatic scenes can unfold. Wayve chose to train its cars in London, because the city’s narrow streets, cyclists and jaywalkers make for a particularly testing environment for drivers. Late last year the firm tested its software for the first time in America: on its first day the car learned for itself to drive on the right side of the road, as well as mastering other oddities. You can almost hear the soaring music in the film version.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But for the most part corporate innovation is not cinematic. The myths of lone geniuses and moments of inspiration undoubtedly capture the imagination. But the reality—of problems solved by groups of determined people over many years—is an even better story.<span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/opinion\">Opinion newsletter</a>, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/12/the-myths-of-corporate-innovation\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Since the launch of Chat<small>GPT</small> in November 2022 the boss of its creator, Open<small>AI</small>, has turned into a global business superstar. He is the darling of both the starch-collared Davos set and Silicon Valley’s dishevelled techno-Utopians. He hangs out with everyone from Katy Perry to Donald Trump, whom he accompanied on a visit to Saudi Arabia this week. It would shock no one if by its next funding round his startup, currently worth $300bn, overtook SpaceX and ByteDance to become the world’s most valuable unlisted firm. The <small>AI</small> wunderkind recently told the <i>Financial Times</i> that he has the “coolest, most important job maybe in history”. No kidding.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Being Sarah Friar is not nearly as fun. As Open<small>AI</small>’s chief financial officer, the Irishwoman has two main tasks. The first is to make sure that the numbers add up. The second is to persuade investors to part with the billions of dollars the firm needs in order to train and run ever cleverer artificial-intelligence (<small>AI</small>) models.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Happily for Ms Friar, moneymen swept up in the <small>AI</small> mania need little persuading. They are falling over themselves to fund Open<small>AI</small>. On May 13th SoftBank, a Japanese tech piggy-bank, said that its $30bn investment in the firm was unaffected by Open<small>ai</small>’s recent decision not to ditch its odd governance structure. A non-profit board will keep control of its for-profit arm.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That is just as well, for going with the flow of investor enthusiasm leaves the <small>CFO</small> more time to tackle her other responsibility. And when it comes to charting a path to profits, the former Oxford University rower is paddling upstream.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">For Open<small>AI, </small>as for any startup, making money involves a series of steps: attract and retain brainboxes, have them create something clever, turn that something into a marketable product, sell more and more of that product while minimising costs until cashflow turns positive. Despite defections, including of several co-founders, Open<small>AI</small> remains a talent magnet. The cleverness of its tech is indisputable. Mr Altman’s claim that the latest o3 model, with an enhanced ability to reason, displays “genius-level intelligence” should be taken with a pinch of salt—but only a pinch.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">It is at the next stage that Ms Friar wades into problems. To see why, consider Open<small>AI</small>’s two more richly valued startup cousins. ByteDance’s recommendation algorithm, which makes TikTok and its Chinese sister app the time sinks that they are, may be a bit more addictive than when it debuted in 2016. SpaceX’s rockets are bigger, more reliable and cheaper than at its first successful launch in 2008. But neither underlying technology has dramatically changed; any additions are, like SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet, complementary. This stability has enabled both firms to build products and, in time, business models around them. Especially for ByteDance, these are lucrative. Last year the social-media titan turned a net profit of $33bn on sales of $155bn.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The reason Open<small>AI</small> will struggle to follow suit is precisely what excites its backers—the sheer pace of <small>AI</small> innovation. It would be one thing for advances to be frequent. The challenge for Ms Friar is that they also frequently upend her firm’s economics.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Some of the disruption comes from Open<small>AI</small>’s rivals. In January a Chinese startup called DeepSeek came out of nowhere with a model that was almost as clever as Open<small>AI</small>’s flagship but required many fewer power-hungry chips to train and use it. DeepSeek also made its code freely available to all and sundry, lowering barriers to entry into advanced model-making. This has eroded Open<small>AI</small>’s competitive advantage at the cutting edge, which it had maintained thanks to access to oodles of computing power courtesy of Microsoft, its big-tech partner. It also constrains its ability to keep raising prices for using its models, which can run to as much as $200 a month per licence.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Competition is, of course, tech’s Schumpeterian lifeblood. Nothing stops Open<small>AI</small> from making its models more efficient, including by adopting some of DeepSeek’s ideas. The trouble is that the economics are changing in more fundamental ways too.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Compare o3 with <small>GPT</small>-4, the model that powered Chat<small>GPT</small> in 2023, and take energy use as a proxy for cost. Open<small>AI</small> is cagey about its numbers. But according to estimates, for every $1 in training costs, <small>GPT</small>-4 would cost around $4 a year to run, based on Open<small>AI’</small>s current level of traffic. For o3, whose reasoning relies on more computing in the post-training “inference” phase, the ratio could be as high as one to 100.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Confounding variables</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">These ballooning operating costs explain Open<small>AI</small>’s mounting losses. Despite tripling its sales to $3.7bn in 2024, it lost perhaps $5bn (excluding stock-based compensation). This year it expects revenue to triple again, to $13bn, and inference costs to grow at the same rate, to $6bn. A shifting cost structure also makes it hard to price products and plan budgets. A fixed subscription fee that made sense in the age of <small>GPT</small>-4 looks unviable for o3. You could try keeping subscriptions for older, dumber versions and add a variable usage fee for inference-heavy reasoning. But how many people will pay anything for an obsolete technology? And how long until the next model forces another complete rethink?</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Any projections for revenue and costs beyond the next few months rest on heroic assumptions. Open<small>AI</small>’s forecast of $125bn in sales and $12bn in cashflow in 2029 might as well be pulled out of a hat. Not because it is too rosy; because it feigns certitude. The same goes for its $300bn price tag: an ungodly sum by startup standards but a trifle next to the $1.4trn in shareholder value Microsoft has created since teaming up with Open<small>Ai</small> in late 2022. This gap may make it easier for Ms Friar to marshal more capital. Yet it also highlights the uncertainty around what her company is truly worth—and the scale of her bookkeeping challenge. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/opinion\">Opinion newsletter</a>, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/05/15/will-openai-ever-make-real-money\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

After sleeping between sheets from MyPillow—a company established by Mike Lindell, a conspiracy theorist—you drink some Black Rifle Coffee, which “serves coffee and culture to people who love America”. You shave with Jeremy’s Razors (“built for rugged jawlines....not feelings”). Then you eat some bacon from Good Ranchers, which pledges to “make the American farm strong again”, before going for a spin on your Harley-Davidson.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The broader <small>MAGA </small>universe extends beyond goods with over-the-top marketing to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/01/conservative-americans-are-building-a-parallel-economy\">products and employers merely favoured by Republicans</a>. And each economic choice adds up to something bigger. According to our analysis, America is splitting into two different economies and markets: one conservative, the other liberal. People on each side think about the economy differently; they buy different things and work in increasingly different industries. Not only that, the <small>MAGA </small>economy is doing surprisingly well.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">American liberals tend to look down on companies that market themselves to conservatives. Although this is in part because they do not like the opposing side, some <small>MAGA </small>products seem like scams. President <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/01/26/will-americas-crypto-frenzy-end-in-disaster\">Donald Trump’s crypto coin</a> soared following its launch, only to crash quickly and leave many supporters holding the bag. His branded watches, including the “Fight Fight Fight” model, cost up to $100,000 and have received mixed reviews.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Such snobbery also reflects a belief that the conservative economy is backward. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, noted that she had “won the places that represent two-thirds of America’s gross domestic product...the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward”. Kamala Harris, the nominee in 2024, won a similar share of America’s <small>GDP</small>. Of course, some solidly Republican districts have long been rich. In Jupiter, a town in Florida, activities include playing golf and wearing white chinos. Yet Yuba City, in northern California, where lots of locals are farmers and people voted strongly for Mr Trump, may be more illustrative of <small>MAGA</small>-land. Incomes are low; shops sell hardware, guns and fast food.

Even places like Yuba City are doing better than before and together <small>MAga</small>-land is enormously powerful. If Democrats have two-thirds of American <small>GDP</small>, that still leaves Republicans with around $10trn—making them the world’s third-largest economy (see chart 1). As anyone who has watched “Friday Night Lights” will know, all parts of America have big spenders. Buddy Garrity, a car dealer, is the archetypal <small>MAGA</small> rich guy. He is not wealthy enough to own a private jet or plugged-in enough to attend the Met Gala; still, he has plenty in the bank.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The growing gap between the <small>MAGA </small>and Democratic economies can be seen in both “soft” and “hard” data. Surveys suggest that Democrats and Republicans now live in separate realities. Before the presidential election 50% of Democrats believed that the economy was getting better, against just 6% of Republicans. Today 8% of Democrats and 49% of Republicans respond in the same way. Such partisanship has become more pronounced. Look, for instance, at the gap in inflation expectations by party, as shown in chart 2.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC347.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Hard data tell a similar story. According to a recent paper by Verena Schoenmueller of Esade<small> </small>University and co-authors, residents in each economy consume in increasingly different ways. After Mr Trump’s victory in 2016, liberals faced a threat to their identity, “which they possibly compensated for by stronger support for liberal-oriented brands”—buying more Patagonia fleeces, perhaps. Tesla shows the power of partisanship better than any other company. <small>TD</small> Cowen, an investment bank, forecasts that Elon Musk’s alliance with Mr Trump will reduce sales by more than 100,000 vehicles a year in Democratic-leaning counties, while boosting sales by twice as much in Republican ones.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Official data also suggest that consumer tastes are splitting along partisan lines. Compare New York, a blue state, with Wyoming, a red one. Since the 1990s blue people have spent more on stereotypical blue goods and services, and red people more on red. New Yorkers have splurged on dining out. They have also jacked up spending on public transport. People in the Equality State, by contrast, spend more than they did on things you might associate with an older, more conservative population, such as vehicle parts and nursing homes.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">It is not just consumption. <small>MAGA </small>and blue economies are behaving increasingly differently, too. They reacted in different ways to the first wave of covid-19. Economic activity in red states, where locals were not so afraid of the virus, fell by half as much as in blue ones. This divergence was the culmination of a long-term trend. The variance in the <small>GDP</small>-growth rates of  Democratic and Republican counties widened sharply around 2008. It has remained about twice as high ever since. In the olden days, when a red place was doing well, you could be pretty sure that a blue place would also be thriving. No longer.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The two economies are separating in part because their industrial compositions are changing. We have analysed data on work and pay across counties. Over time, places that voted Democratic in 2024 have taken a greater share of knowledge-intensive forms of economic activity. In 1993 roughly the same share of employee compensation came from the “information” sector, comprising software and the like, in Republican counties as elsewhere. Now the share is 30% lower than average, while dependence on manufacturing has risen. All told, employment patterns in the Democratic and Republican economies have diverged by 20%, as measured by the difference between “location quotients”, a gauge of job dispersion by industry.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Buddy up</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Nevertheless, there are more Buddy Garritys today. In 2024, 47% of Americans reporting annual incomes above $1m lived in Trump-voting states, up from 43% in 2014. Incomes among poorer folk are rising, too. Population growth is strong. And the <small>MAGA </small>economy has lots of big businesses that liberals rarely encounter. Yuba City is home to WinCo, which feels like a knock-off Costco, and Boot Barn, which sells cowboy boots. Fox News’s viewers are on the poorer side, yet over the past year the firm’s share price has been on a tear.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Olive Garden, an Italian-restaurant chain, is another example in Yuba City. According to a YouGov poll in 2023-24, it is the dining option second most favoured by Republicans, relative to Democrats, behind Cracker Barrel, which offers wooden rocking chairs and Southern cuisine. Although the pasta at Olive Garden may not be <i>fatta in casa</i>, it is popular. The share price of Darden, which runs the chain, has nearly tripled in the past five years.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC353.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">These trends play out across America. Along with Kai Wu of Sparkline Capital, a fund manager, we assembled 30 listed firms that are seen favourably by Republicans or Democrats, based on surveys. The process was inevitably imprecise: there is no single poll that covers all companies. In the end, the Republican basket included firms such as John Deere, Fox and Harley-Davidson, whereas the Democratic one featured Etsy, Lululemon, Lyft and more. Recent market turmoil hit the Republican basket hard. But in the past decade its shareholder returns, including dividends, have thrashed the blue one (see chart 3).</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-3\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Why do <small>MAGA </small>firms seem to outperform? Maybe they eschew virtue-signalling. Point Bridge America First, an exchange-traded fund that uses the stock ticker <small>MAGA</small>, includes only those firms which support Republicans. The Democratic Large-Cap Core Fund, with the stock ticker <small>DEMZ</small>, invests in companies that make big donations to the Democrats. Since the end of 2020 <small>MAGA</small>’s price has easily outperformed that of <small>DEMZ</small>. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has built a stock index containing firms “that could benefit from key Republican policies”, such as those in oil. Over the past decade their share prices have comfortably beaten the market.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The future for the <small>MAGA </small>economy is uncertain. By raising the cost of imported components, Mr Trump’s tariffs will hurt manufacturing. Harley-Davidson is a soft target for foreign politicians looking to retaliate. On the flip side, however, Republican states, including Florida and Texas, are still enticing internal migrants. And with local consumer confidence strong, expect spending in <small>MAGA</small>-land to hold up better than in Democratic-leaning areas. It does not just rely on MyPillow. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics,&nbsp;finance and markets, sign up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks\" target=\"_blank\">Money Talks</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/13/why-the-maga-economy-is-thriving\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

There is, however, something able to induce self-harm: partisanship.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Investors have every incentive to make smart decisions regardless of their party affiliation. Yet a recent YouGov poll—conducted on behalf of <i>The Economist</i> from May 2nd to 5th, when the stockmarket was down by an average of 8% since its peak on February 19th—indicates they nevertheless struggle. The polling suggests that partisanship coloured trading decisions and perceptions of the market in the wake of President Donald Trump’s recent tariffs.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">There has been little academic research into the impact of partisanship on retail investors; the work that exists mostly focuses on the attitudes and behaviour of credit analysts, portfolio managers and regulators. In 2017 a rare study by Yosef&nbsp;Bonaparte of the University of Colorado, Denver, and co-authors found that retail types tend to prefer riskier assets and to invest at home when their party is in power, reflecting greater optimism about the economy.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"1006\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC344.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Our polling suggests that the topic may be worthy of further study. Among Americans who owned stocks this year or last, a fifth of Democrats (and the same proportion of independents) reported taking money out of the stockmarket or mutual funds owing to Mr Trump’s salvo, compared with just a tenth of Republicans. Red Americans were much more upbeat about the state of the market. Some 43% said that it was in good or excellent condition, compared with only 16% of Democrats. As for the influence of the president, 66% of Democratic investors held Mr Trump “very responsible” for market conditions, compared with just 21% of Republicans.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Even on matters of fact, Democrats’ and Republicans’ perceptions differed wildly. Among Democrats, two-thirds correctly said in early May that the stockmarket had dropped since January, compared with less than half of Republicans. Likewise, in a poll that was conducted from July 9th to 11th 2022, when Joe Biden was president, less than half of Democrats versus more than two-thirds of Republicans reckoned the market had dropped since January 2021; in fact, it had risen. Expectations blind some investors to reality.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Yet reality can break through. A recent study by Alok Kumar of Miami Herbert Business School and colleagues finds that, on revelations of large boss-worker pay gaps, institutional shareholders in Democratic-leaning, “inequality averse” counties at first sell off more than those in Republican-leaning areas—before then reversing course within three months when the firms demonstrate strong performance.

Li Chenggang, a Chinese official, replied with a wry smile and an old saying: “Good food is never too late.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The dish, when it at last arrived on Monday May 12th, was surprisingly tasty. America had agreed to cut the “reciprocal” tariff it inflicted on China last month from 125% to a more digestible 10% for at least 90 days. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/01/why-china-has-the-upper-hand-in-its-trade-war-with-america\">China has agreed to do the same</a>. It&nbsp;will also&nbsp;suspend&nbsp;other retaliatory measures,&nbsp;such as restrictions on 17 American companies deemed “unreliable entities”.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The agreement therefore reverses much of the April madness. Indeed, the <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P</small> 500 share-price index of large American companies is now 5% higher than it was at the end of March. China’s <small>CSI</small> 300 is about the same as it was back then.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Tariffs imposed by each country before April will, however, remain. They include an American levy of 20% intended to punish China for making the ingredients of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, as well as the narrower duties that China adopted in retaliation. Moreover, America’s tariffs now apply even to “small value” packages, worth less than $800, which previously escaped duties on the grounds the revenue was not worth the hassle of collecting. That exception ended on May 2nd.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"665\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_FNC375.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The result is that even after the agreement, America’s tariffs on China average about 39%, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank, when they are weighted by the value of last year’s imports. At the same time, China’s tariff on America averages about 27%, at least assuming that China continues quietly to exempt American chemicals, medicines and other essential goods from the duties. Both of these averages are far higher than when the year began, although they are also much lower than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when Mr Trump was admonishing China for a “lack of respect” and China was digging in for a protracted trade war (see chart).</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Before the talks began, Scott Bessent, America’s treasury secretary, had said the two sides were seeking merely to agree on what to talk about. Mr Trump had posted on social media that a tariff of 80% on China “seems right!” When the negotiating teams were seen leaving the venue after only a few hours on Saturday, some feared the talks had broken down. In fact, the negotiators were just going for lunch.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">What, then, explains China’s unexpected success? Jamieson Greer, America’s trade representative, gave credit to the venue. The negotiations took place not in a “sterile” hotel, but in the intimate rooms and attractive grounds of an ambassador’s residence. According to Mr Greer, many of the most difficult issues were discussed on patio sofas under a beautiful tree.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Meanwhile, the economic backdrop was becoming much less comfy. Chinese exports to America fell by more than a fifth in April compared with a year earlier. The prices of Chinese goods listed on the websites of big American retailers have also been rising slowly but relentlessly, according to data scraped by Alberto Cavallo of Harvard University and his co-authors.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In a press conference on May 12th, Mr Bessent all but conceded that tariffs on China had got out of hand. Mr Trump had announced a “reciprocal” levy of 34% on China on April 2nd, or “Liberation Day”, as the president called it. That had quickly jumped to 84% and then 125% in response to Chinese retaliation. The result was the “equivalent of an embargo”, which neither country wanted, Mr Bessent said.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Sealed with the Swiss</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The financial chaos following Liberation Day included a bond-market revolt and a plunging dollar. This disturbance persuaded Mr Trump to offer a 90-day reprieve to most of America’s trading partners on April 9th. After the Geneva talks, China has now been added to the list. Its reciprocal tariff of 10% is as low as any country enjoys. Moreover, this low rate applies even though China, unlike other countries, still has a 10% retaliatory tariff in place.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Now the most important question is what happens after Mr Trump’s latest 90-day pause. Typical trade agreements take considerably longer to negotiate. And America’s commercial grievances with China run especially deep, encompassing its industrial policies and implicit subsidies for state-owned enterprises. Mr Bessent was careful to point out that the 34% tariff chosen for China on Liberation Day is not a dead letter. It is the default to which America will return after the pause, if nothing happens in the interim.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">To forestall that possibility China could conceivably agree to buy more commodities, such as oil or soyabeans, from America—goods that it might anyway have bought from elsewhere. It could also convince American politicians that it really is working harder to crack down on the production of fentanyl ingredients. Mr Bessent was impressed that China’s delegation included a minister of public security, who was well-versed on the drug-traffic issue. Maybe the two superpowers will orchestrate a compromise in which America raises the reciprocal tariff back to 34% but removes the 20% fentanyl penalty. That might be enough to turn the Swiss truce into a more lasting peace.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-3\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The Chinese adage about the punctuality of good food often continues to another line: “Interesting talk is never too slow.” If they are to avoid a return to the tariff disaster of the past months, China and America must hope that their talks over the next 90 days do not drag or bore. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i><b>Correction (May 13th, 2025)</b>:&nbsp;An earlier version of this piece said that Mr Bessent was impressed that China’s delegation included the minister of public security.</i></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics,&nbsp;finance and markets, sign up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks\" target=\"_blank\">Money Talks</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/12/america-has-given-china-a-strangely-good-tariff-deal\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

But stroll down its main path and a café comes into view, with baristas manning an espresso machine. Next door is a tiny bakery with a wood-fired oven. Nearby, a farm-house pottery studio and an artist’s gallery.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In a country where rural areas remain poor, Xiaotao stands out. It is part of a state project to revitalise China’s countryside with businesses, industry and youngsters. A university campus has been built close by. There are new eateries and hotels. “The hope is that young people can find something to do and end up staying,” says a local art professor.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">For decades urban factories have sucked up able rural bodies, in a process officials have depended on for economic growth, even as it hollowed out villages. In recent years, local governments have sought to make it easier to move from the village to the city by reforming the <i>hukou </i>system, which keeps individuals tethered to the places they are born.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But at the start of the year the central government released a “rural revitalisation plan”. At its heart is an effort to lift rural incomes: in 2024 urbanites made on average more than double what rural folk did. The plan aims to make it easier for entrepreneurs to set up businesses; Xiaotao is a model village.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Surely it is contradictory to want to fill both cities and the countryside? Communist Party officials would suggest otherwise. Their most commonly used term for urbanisation roughly translates to “urban- and town-isation”. The goal is not to cram people into megacities, which are already crowded, but to spread them among a wide range of urban areas. Recently that has meant making villages a bit more citylike. Many have grown and are becoming increasingly commercial, says Shen Jianfa of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">It is not just the coffee shops and bucolic scenery that are drawing young people back to villages. As China’s economy deteriorates, jobs in cities are becoming scarcer. Urban youth unemployment is uncomfortably high, having reached 17% in February. Many young people feel burnt out and see little opportunity for progress. Xiaotao, says the art professor, should be a place they can come to get away from the pressure. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics,&nbsp;finance and markets, sign up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks\" target=\"_blank\">Money Talks</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/15/how-the-chinese-communist-party-learnt-to-love-villages\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Many had arrived in Washington for talks, desperately seeking trade deals, only to find America’s negotiators abroad and their meetings delayed or cancelled. One official, who expected to present painstakingly crafted positions on bovine-vaccination rules and currency manipulation, took the chance to visit the newly refurbished Air and Space Museum. He then left “about as empty-handed as before”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">America’s stated ambition has been to sign 90 trade deals in 90 days. The clock started ticking on April 9th, when reciprocal tariffs on roughly as many countries were paused, and will continue until a deadline on July 8th. Over a third of the way through the period, only two deals have been announced. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/08/trumps-trade-deal-with-britain-will-worry-allies-and-rivals-alike\">One with Britain</a>, an ally with which America has been in talks for a decade. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/12/america-has-given-china-a-strangely-good-tariff-deal\">The other with China</a>, a rival with which President Donald Trump had ignited a fierce trade war. Tariffs came down in both instances; neither country granted America big concessions.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The remaining 88 countries have employed plenty of diplomatic charm in seeking to advance their case, but have made slow and uneven progress. No negotiating team has stayed at the front of the queue for long. Squabbling over a deal’s fine print leads to a swift demotion. As the clock ticks down, the stakes rise. Nobody wants to be out in the cold on July 8th.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Since mid-April, the Trump administration has prioritised 20 or so economies. These include big trading partners that would be heavily penalised by the deferred reciprocal tariffs, such as the European Union, Japan and Vietnam, as well as a few minnows, such as Fiji. A smattering of leaders with whom Mr Trump gets on, such as Argentina’s Javier Milei, also made the list. The larger the trading partner, the more American consumers would feel painful price rises in the absence of a deal. American policymakers believe that negotiations with Britain and Fiji are a useful signal of their desires to countries that are further back in the queue, and one which should accelerate other negotiations.</p><div data-optimizely=\"onward-articles-component\" style=\"display:none\" class=\"css-1dmm17z ejvhmuq1\"><div class=\"section-header_mb-section-header__Wk_hk

Donald Trump coverage</span></a></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Given the tumultuous nature of talks so far, such rationalisations are not entirely convincing. All the discussions are vulnerable to presidential whims. At first, America’s priority was big East Asian exporters, including Japan and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/04/07/trumps-tariffs-will-pummel-vietnam\">Vietnam.</a> But after Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s prime minister, said that America’s insistence on excluding sectoral tariffs from negotiations was unfair, India stole his country’s position—only to then lose ground because of the slow pace of its own negotiations. Having lost priority status, Indian officials duly filed a motion with the World Trade Organisation, seeking to toughen their export controls on America. After Mr Trump’s negotiators received a warm welcome from Switzerland over the weekend, the president said that it would be bumped up the line. Only the <small>EU </small>has maintained a consistent position throughout: at the back of the queue. Mr Trump has called the bloc “nastier than China” as a negotiating partner. More diplomatically, Mr Bessent notes that talks are tough because, “The Italians want something that is different from the French.”</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Three themes stand out so far. The first, and most important, is that no country manages to hold America’s attention for long. In normal times, trade deals are negotiated bilaterally. Even defining broad terms, which is what Mr Trump is mostly attempting at present, tends to take years. American negotiators seem to believe that their current speed-run approach offers leverage. If they reach a stumbling-point with one country, well, no problem—they can simply move on to the next. Witness the fate of Japan when it urged America to remove its tariff of 25% on car imports.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The difficulty is that as different countries make it to the front, the hopes of their negotiators rise. Perhaps it will be they who charm the Trump administration into a uniquely good deal. For example, India also attempted to persuade America to remove car and steel tariffs as part of a “zero for zero” deal. Yet only Britain has earned any such carve-out, and even then for just 100,000 cars a year. As such attempts fail, churn is the result. “It feels like the window of opportunity each time is very small,” says a Vietnamese official.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Beijing barrier</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Next is the China factor. Third countries have two superpowers to keep happy. On May 14th Chinese officials attacked Britain’s deal with America, alleging that it indirectly targets China. Under the terms of the agreement, Britain escapes tariffs on steel exports, but only if America gets a say over who owns its plants. Other “national security” measures in the deal also upset China. Such complaints will arise again. Japan feared that America’s demands on strategic goods would irritate China. America’s negotiators raise the question of “What are you doing and what could you do vis-à-vis China?” in every negotiation, according to one official.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The third theme concerns unforeseen sticking-points. Countries that exchange hundreds of thousands of goods each year often have specific gripes. British officials complained to their American counterparts about the quality of Uncle Sam’s beef. American officials have demanded that Japanese politicians liberalise their rice market, a political taboo, and made unsubstantiated allegations of currency manipulation against Thailand. Sometimes disputes have little to do with commerce. On May 1st Thailand dropped charges against Paul Chambers, an American academic imprisoned for <i>lèse-majesté </i>(insulting royalty) in a move Thai officials insisted was unrelated to trade talks. Diplomatic dances over such issues would usually take years. Mr Trump has less time, meaning they can derail negotiations.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">America is not going to meet its original ambition of signing 90 trade agreements by July 8th. More deals will nevertheless have been signed by that time. And negotiations with many countries will continue beyond the deadline, with their officials hoping for an extension of the present tariff pause to tide them over.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">At the same time, Mr Trump will need to show his threats are credible, so as to garner concessions, predicts Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council, a think-tank: “There will be a few examples made.” For most countries, the goal should not be to make it to the front of the queue. It should be to avoid falling to the back. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics,&nbsp;finance and markets, sign up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks\" target=\"_blank\">Money Talks</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/15/china-has-got-lucky-with-trump-can-the-rest-of-the-world\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Speak to those who analyse them for a living and you will still detect a note of disbelief—they can hardly remember the last time foreign investors were paying them as much attention. Why that should be is no mystery. Measured in dollars, Europe’s Stoxx 600 index has risen by 16% in 2025, compared with 3% for the <small>MSCI</small> World.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">More mysterious, Europe’s highest-soaring stockmarket has slipped beneath many investors’ radars. Everyone knows that share prices in Germany have rocketed, and that those of its armsmakers have gone ballistic. Yet its <small>DAX</small> index is up by a paltry 27% (in dollars again) this year. Poland’s <small>WIG</small> has risen by over 40% and, since a trough in 2022, has nearly tripled. Quietly, a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2024/10/17/polands-stockmarket-has-a-hot-new-entrant\">long-moribund market</a> has become Europe’s superstar.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">“Poland is the new Germany,” says Peter Bosek, chief executive of Erste Group Bank, an Austrian lender that is acquiring Santander Bank Polska, Poland’s third-largest. The analogy works in several ways. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, but especially over the past two decades, Poland has achieved a stunning economic transformation—reminiscent of Germany’s in the second half of the 20th century. By the World Bank’s standards, it dodged the “middle-income trap” that ensnared economies elsewhere, moving to high-income status in just 15 years. The <small>IMF</small> reckons that, this year, Poland’s <small>GDP</small> per person will exceed Japan’s, adjusted for purchasing power. In 2005 Poland’s income on this measure was 50% of the <small>EU</small> average; in 2025 the <small>IMF</small> thinks it will rise to 85%.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Until recently, though, Poland’s success did little to boost the appeal of its stockmarket to international investors. Between 2010 and 2020, share prices were more or less flat in dollar terms. During the covid-19 pandemic and the crash of 2022, they convulsed along with markets elsewhere. Then, in 2023, Poles started looking more German in a second way: by booting their populist, interventionist and anti-<small>EU</small> Law and Justice (<small>P</small>i<small>S</small>) party out of power.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In its place they elected an investor-friendly alliance led by Donald Tusk, a former president of the European Council. <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>’s approach to markets had included installing a crony to run Poland’s central bank, which then slashed interest rates during the 2023 election campaign, despite inflation being at 10%. Meanwhile Orlen, a state-run and <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>-controlled energy firm, conveniently cut fuel prices. Mr Tusk’s comparatively hands-off administration has made Poland far more investible. And it has so far unlocked €21bn ($23bn) in post-covid aid from the <small>EU</small>, which had previously been withheld owing to <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>’s meddling with the courts.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That left Polish shares poised to participate—and then some—in Europe’s rally this year, as investors have reconsidered their outsize allocations to America and wondered where else they can park their cash. How about the stockmarket of a mid-sized, rich country that is boosting its growth prospects with a big fiscal stimulus and a determination to re-arm?</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The reasoning that has led many to Germany applies to Poland, too. In 2025 it expects to spend 4.7% of its <small>GDP</small> on defence, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/01/22/how-poland-emerged-as-a-leading-defence-power\">more than any other <small>NATO</small> member</a> and up from 2.2% in 2022. So far, much of that has gone on imports to replace the hardware Poland sent to Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, and so has done little to raise <small>GDP</small>. But that will soon change, since Poland is also acquiring manufacturing and maintenance capacity. The government says it will spend 50% of its funds for technological modernisation on equipment made in Poland. Faster growth should follow.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">More immediately, points out Mai Doan of Bank of America, Poland should benefit from German growth, which is set to speed up as Germany spends more on defence and infrastructure. She estimates that higher German growth passes through almost one-for-one across the border, since it translates into higher demand for Polish exports, including capital goods and military gear.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">There are limits to how fast money can flow into Polish stocks with the <small>WIG</small> index’s market value at just $520bn. Nevertheless, 40% of that is made up of the shares of financial firms which are well-placed to harvest returns from a strong economy. The market remains enticingly cheap. Share prices are only ten times firms’ expected earnings for this year, compared with 15 for Europe more broadly and 22 for America. For now, the rise of the Warsaw Stock Exchange has attracted little attention. Do not bet on that continuing.&nbsp;<span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/opinion\">Opinion newsletter</a>, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/14/poland-the-ignored-stockmarket-superstar\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The question befuddles everyone. On May 8th President Donald Trump broke with decades of Republican convention when he reportedly urged Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives, to increase America’s highest federal levy on incomes from 37% to 39.6%, where it stood before the president’s own reforms in 2017. Mr Trump then took to social media to announce that although he would “graciously accept” such a change “in order to help the lower and middle income workers”, Republicans in Congress “should probably not do it”. He is nevertheless “<small>OK</small> if they do”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">This is usually the point at which to compare Mr Trump’s haphazard argument with the staid advice of economists. But they seem just as confused as the president. Their research on the best level for the top rate of income tax can include statements such as: “alternative parameter values give a range of -26% to 50%” (you read that right: a negative tax for top earners may be best). Other economists recommend rates as high as 70% or more, once taxes at all levels of government and income are included.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Why is it as hard for economists as it is for politicians to deduce the correct level for one of the most high-profile numbers in economic policy? One reason is the ethical judgment involved. Economists are more comfortable talking about efficiency than redistribution. Historically, research on “optimal taxation”, rooted in the work of Sir James Mirrlees, a British economist, combined the two concepts with an intuitive belief that an extra dollar of wealth buys less additional happiness the richer you are. A utilitarian government—one that seeks to maximise the sum total of human well-being—might redistribute a lot of cash if (to use mathematical terms for the idea) utility functions are concave.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But happiness cannot easily be measured, and utilitarianism is anyway controversial: it ascribes no clear value to rights, meritocracy, poverty thresholds or notions of just desert. In 2016 Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefanie Stantcheva of Harvard University demonstrated that aggregated utility functions could be replaced by more general “weights”. Under such an approach, you tell economists how much you value—for whatever ethical reason—each person’s marginal dollar of income, and they can tell you how to set efficient taxes.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Or at least, they can try. Because even after “society” decides those weights, the economics that remains is supremely difficult. Mirrlees’s framework focused on the degree to which taxes on labour, by discouraging work, reduce the incomes of the rich. To the extent there is a consensus on this distortion, it is that a 1% fall in the after-tax returns to work for high earners prompts their pre-tax earnings to drop by only 0.25%. Plug that number into a traditional formula, alongside other standard results, and you get an ideal top rate of tax in the region of 70% or more, including taxes at all levels of government and social-security levies.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The trouble is that the framework ignores a timeless question: how much does society as a whole benefit from letting people get rich? This is no small omission, given the spillover benefits from entrepreneurship and innovation. William Nordhaus of Yale University has estimated that innovators have historically captured for themselves only about 2% of the total surplus they create. In the extreme, such spillovers matter a great deal. The benefits of entrepreneurship are part of the explanation for why capitalism outperforms control economies such as that of North Korea.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Economists have only recently tried to incorporate the incentive to innovate into their calculation of optimal top taxes. It was one attempt to do so, by Charles Jones of Stanford University, that entertained the negative top rate of -26%. If high earners produce a lot of ideas that help society, then “subsidising the discovery of new ideas through low tax rates may be as effective as redistribution in raising worker welfare”, he writes. In April Ms Stantcheva won the John Bates Clark medal, awarded each year by the American Economic Association to the leading economist under the age of 40, in part for her work on the matter. She has found that personal income taxes (and corporate levies) significantly deter innovation, though also that targeted policies, such as research and development subsidies, can be used as counterweights.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Business, unfinished</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Perhaps this line of research will in time produce a consensus on the top rate of tax. Until it does, politicians have no choice but to follow their gut, and what works elsewhere. They might look to Scandinavia, which is home to dynamic economies and raises lots of tax, in part, it seems, by avoiding super-high levies on the rich. Sweden’s top rate of income tax, for example, is only a smidgen above America’s, once state and local levies are included. The big difference between the systems is that Sweden has a swingeing 25% rate of <small>VAT</small>, a levy on consumption that is painful for the poor but does not discourage work. It is a means to an end: Scandinavia’s additional redistribution is done on the spending side of the ledger, with taxes kept pretty efficient.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">“Efficient” is not the word you would use to describe the plans of Republicans in Congress. As they prepare to cut taxes, they have so far resisted Mr Trump’s half-hearted call for a more progressive system. But their draft bill, released on May 12th, includes all manner of distortions, from exempting overtime and tips from taxable income, to increasing the deduction for state and local levies—a hand-out that subsidises tax increases at lower levels of government. Mr Trump’s tariffs, meanwhile, stray about as far from optimal tax theory as it is possible to get. Economics may not be able to tell you how much to tax the rich. Nevertheless, it can still identify these ideas as foolish. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/opinion\">Opinion newsletter</a>, which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/15/economists-are-as-confused-as-trump-about-taxing-the-rich\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Together, these represent the future of aerial warfare.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Fighter jets tend to be categorised by their age, features and sophistication. The first generation appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of those in <small>NATO </small>service today, like America’s ubiquitous <small>F</small>-16, are fourth-generation ones, built from the 1970s to the 1990s. The latest fifth-generation planes, such as the <small>F</small>-35 and <small>F</small>-22, the latter perhaps the leading fighter jet in operation today, tend to enjoy stealth, the capacity for sustained supersonic flight and advanced computer systems.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">By comparison with earlier planes, the sixth generation of jets all have one thing in common—they’re big. Early images of the <small>F</small>-47 have been heavily obscured and edited, and might bear little resemblance to the final plane. But photos of the <small>J</small>-36 and models of the Tempest (pictured) indicate aircraft far larger than the fourth-generation Chinese<small> J</small>-20 and European Typhoon or fifth-gen American <small>F</small>-35 and<small> F</small>-22. The similarity suggests that all these countries have similar prognoses about the future of war in the air.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">One shift they all predict is more, and better, surface-to-air missile systems, a lesson reinforced by the strong performance of air defences in Ukraine. That requires more stealth to keep planes hidden from enemy radar. Stealth, in turn, requires smooth surfaces—bombs and missiles cannot hang off the wing, but must be tucked away inside a larger body.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Keeping their distance</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">A second shift is in the increasing range of air combat. For the past 40 years, the proportion of air-to-air kills that occur “beyond visual range” has grown steadily—from a tiny fraction of all in the 1970s to more than half between 1990 and 2002. Since then air-to-air missiles have been able to travel ever farther. Europe’s Meteor, with a 200km range, was at the forefront of technology when it was first tested a decade ago. America’s <small>AIM</small>-174<small>B</small> and China’s <small>PL</small>-17 can now hit things 400km away. That means planes need better sensors to spot and fire at targets from farther away; they also need better electronic warfare equipment to parry incoming threats. These technologies require more space to generate power and remove all the heat that electronics tend to produce.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Finally, planes are especially vulnerable to long-range missiles when they are on the ground. That means they need to fly from more distant airfields, requiring larger fuel tanks and less drag for more efficient flight. The huge wings seen on the Tempest and the <small>J</small>-36 allow for both those things, notes Bill Sweetman, an aviation expert. Range is a particular concern for America. Its airbases in Japan are within reach of vast numbers of Chinese ballistic missiles. It plans to disperse its planes more widely in wartime and to fly them from more distant runways, such as those in Australia and on Pacific islands.</p><iframe src=\"https://infographics.economist.com/2025/20250517_STC989\" title=\"\" height=\"auto\" class=\"css-4nk67h e1mvczvy0\"></iframe><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Long-range planes are appealing for several reasons. “We’re talking about really extreme ranges,” notes Group Captain Bill, the Royal Air Force (<small>RAF</small>) officer in charge of thinking through how the service will use the Tempest, speaking recently (without his surname) on the “Team Tempest” podcast, which is produced by the consortium building the aircraft. The plane will need to be able to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a single tank of fuel, he says, a journey that would require today’s Typhoon jet to be refuelled three or four times. One reason for that might be that big refuelling tankers, which once sat safely to the rear of the front line, are increasingly vulnerable to new air-to-air missiles, like China’s <small>PL</small>-17. Another is that the Tempest could then take circuitous routes, avoiding Russian air defences along the obvious paths.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Put all this together and you get planes that look like old-fashioned bombers. Mr Sweetman compares the hulking <small>J</small>-36, with massive wings and cavernous weapon bays, to an “airborne cruiser”, optimised for range, stealth and carrying capacity over dogfighting agility. The single most important requirement for the Tempest is the ability to carry a lot of weapons, says Group Captain Bill, noting that it will have roughly double the payload of the beefiest <small>F</small>-35. That makes sense: if you can deliver more firepower per sortie, you can destroy a target with fewer risky flights into enemy airspace. “The same answers tend to pop up for all,” says Mike Pryce, who has advised Britain’s defence ministry on combat air design. “Stand off, don’t be seen, shoot first, don’t get into a knife fight.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">As the planes get bigger, their insides are also evolving into what are essentially “flying supercomputers”, says Roberto Cingolani, the <small>CEO </small>of Leonardo, an Italian company that is developing the wider Tempest programme along with Britain’s <small>BAE </small>Systems and Japan’s Mitsubishi. Leonardo says that the Tempest will be able to “suck up” a medium-sized city’s worth of data in one second, according to Tim Robinson of the Royal Aeronautical Society. That could include anything from radio traffic to the emissions of air-defence radars. The point is to share that data with friendly forces, including tanks and ships, says Mr Cingolani, perhaps via satellite, with a “central artificial intelligence” making decisions—presumably which targets should be attacked, by what, and when. Some might suggest “that’s science fiction,” he says. “No, that’s a vision.” </p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Flying together</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Perhaps the most contentious design choice is whether sixth-generation planes should have pilots. Elon Musk, Mr Trump’s aide, recently mocked the fact that “Some idiots are still building manned fighter jets.” In practice, most air forces believe that artificial intelligence (<small>AI</small>) and autonomy are not yet mature enough to allow a computer to replace a human pilot entirely; that will take until 2040, reckons the <small>RAF</small>. Images of the <small>F</small>-47, though unreliable guides to the final product, depict “a relatively large bubble canopy”, notes Thomas Newdick of the War Zone, a website, “providing the pilot with excellent vision”. Some missions are particularly sensitive: France will use the <small>FCAS </small>to deliver nuclear weapons, a task that may always remain a human prerogative.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-3\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Nevertheless, the prevailing idea is that sixth-generation planes will be the core of a larger “combat air system”, in which a human in the cockpit controls a larger fleet of uncrewed drones, known, in American parlance, as collaborative combat aircraft (<small>CCA</small>). “The concept is that you have an aircraft-carrier that is flying,” says Mr Cingolani. “It’s an entire fleet that moves in the sky and makes decisions.” The human in the cockpit is best described not as a pilot, says Group Captain Bill, but as a “weapons system officer”, the <small>RAF</small>’s term for someone managing sensors and weaponry.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">On May 1st America’s air force announced that it had begun ground testing its two <small>CCA </small>prototypes in advance of flight tests later this year. Current order numbers suggest that each <small>F</small>-47 will get two <small>CCAs</small>. The drones might scout ahead, spot targets or carry weapons themselves—all within line-of-sight and under “tight control”, notes Frank Kendall, a former air-force secretary. Much of the intensive computing required to carry out these tasks will need to take place on board the crewed mothership, with relevant data shared to all craft instantaneously, says Mr Cingolani, speaking in the context of the Tempest. He emphasises that the communication links have to be secure. “I’m not sure in ten years we can make it.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">If he and his company can pull it off, it will cost a pretty penny. Mr Kendall, in the Biden administration, paused the development of the <small>F</small>-47 in large part because it was expected to cost twice as much as the <small>F</small>-35—perhaps as much as $160m-180m apiece—which would mean the government could afford only a small fleet of 200 or so planes. Many in the Pentagon wanted a greater emphasis on building <small>CCA</small>s to complement the existing fleet of <small>F</small>-35s, rather than pouring money into a new platform that might not turn up until long after a war with China.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In Britain, Justin Bronk, an air power expert at the Royal United Services Institute, expresses similar concerns, drawing an analogy with the experimental versus war-winning weapons of the second world war. “Pouring all the money that defence can spare…into a programme that, in the best case, will not deliver a fully operational capability before 2040 feels to me like the <small>UK </small>concentrating all Air Ministry resources on Avro Vulcan development in 1936,” he says, citing a plane that did not appear until a decade after the war was over, “rather than Hurricanes, Spitfires, Blenheims, Whitleys and Wellingtons.” <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Curious about the world?

The core idea is to deliberately interfere with the environment in order to cool the climate, thus averting the worst consequences of the unintentional interference caused by rampant fossil-fuel combustion. Most of the potential methods involve reflecting sunlight back into space, thereby stopping that energy being trapped in the atmosphere as heat. Those in favour of researching them point to their potential to cheaply and substantially reduce global temperatures. Critics, meanwhile, highlight the risk of altering weather systems and disrupting atmospheric chemistry (with global and ungovernable consequences) while distracting countries from the hard but necessary work of cutting carbon emissions.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In an attempt to provide some evidence, Britain’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (<small>ARIA</small>), an independent funding organisation backed by public money, announced at the end of April that it would be providing £56.8m ($75.4m) to geoengineering projects. The funding will be disbursed over the next five years to 21 projects exploring various dimensions of the problem. That announcement is enough to make Britain the largest state funder of solar-geoengineering research. That represents nearly 40% of all solar geoengineering funding that <small>SRM</small>360, an educational non-profit, estimates was awarded up to the end of 2024.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><small>ARIA </small>is spending heavily in part because it is throwing a wide net. It wants&nbsp; to “look holistically” across different technologies and approaches, to see if “they could ever be effective or scalable”, says Mark Symes, an electrochemist at the University of Glasgow and the programme’s director.</p><div class=\"css-izf7kx enls6fv1\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_STC362.png\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Chart: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">To that end, half of the cash is earmarked for five projects which propose to conduct outdoor experiments. One, in the Canadian Arctic, will look at deliberately thickening patches of sea ice to see if that helps it last through the summer season. Two others (one at a site on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, another somewhere in Britain) will attempt to use fine sprays of seawater to increase the reflectivity of either the clouds or the atmosphere more broadly. Another experiment, also in Britain, will assess whether changing a cloud’s electric charge will affect its brightness. And the final experiment, to be conducted in either America or Britain, will see what happens when tiny amounts of reflective aerosols are exposed to the stratosphere.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Such experiments are a novelty: almost all previous proposals have been cancelled or put off due to public outcry. That means a lot of critical basic science has not been done, says Dr Symes. To minimise the chance of harmful consequences, <small>ARIA </small>has imposed strict limits on the scale of these experiments, including their geographic extent. All must also be subject to an environmental assessment and secure the agreement of nearby communities. An oversight committee will also provide <small>ARIA</small> with independent expert advice.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Of the other projects, roughly a quarter are aimed at answering questions either about the ethics of geoengineering or how it might be regulated. Another seven are dedicated to modelling efforts, and a further four aim to study the real-world processes that affect how sunlight is reflected to improve future monitoring. (One modelling project is being conducted by The Degrees Initiative, a non-profit chaired by a member of <i>The Economist</i>’s<i> </i>staff.)</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Such projects should clarify whether geoengineering can ever be a viable option to avert dangerous climate tipping-points. But <small>ARIA </small>remains adamant that it is no silver bullet. “This is not a substitute for decarbonisation,” says Dr Symes.

He was not eating and slept too much. Blood tests revealed sky-high levels of ammonia, a toxic substance the body usually expels. Genome sequencing confirmed that he had a rare genetic disease called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (<small>CPS</small>1) deficiency, which often kills in infancy, and for which no good neonatal treatment exists. Then one of his doctors suggested something radical: a gene-editing drug designed specifically for him.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">At face value, the idea was preposterous. Drug development takes years, time <small>KJ </small>did not have. But his doctor, Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a metabolic-disease expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and her colleague Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist from the University of Pennsylvania, believed they could produce a drug in months. Remarkably, their plan seems to have worked. <small>KJ </small>is now preparing to leave the hospital for the first time and go home to his family, after becoming the first person to be treated with a bespoke gene-editing therapy. This breakthrough could allow such treatments to one day become a routine option for children with debilitating genetic diseases.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Gene editing works by tweaking the molecular building blocks of <small>DNA</small>, known as bases, to restore the normal function of a mutated gene. <small>KJ</small>’s disease was caused by just such a mutation in a gene responsible for producing an enzyme called <small>CPS</small>1. Normally<small> CPS</small>1 helps turn ammonia, which is produced when the gut digests protein, into another chemical that is excreted with urine. Without a working enzyme, ammonia build-up eventually poisons the brain, which can lead to coma and death.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Dr Ahrens-Nicklas and her colleagues opted to make the necessary correction with a new version of the gene-editing tool <small>CRISPR </small>known as base editing. Whereas conventional <small>CRISPR </small>edits genes by excising or inserting bases, base editing chemically converts one base into another. In all other respects it works like any <small>CRISPR </small>drug: an enzyme known as the editor is guided to the right place in the genome by an <small>RNA </small>molecule designed to match the mutated stretch of <small>DNA</small>. Drs Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru had spent years pairing editors with <small>RNA </small>molecules to fix metabolism-related mutations in more common diseases. They felt hopeful they could do the same for <small>KJ </small>on a much shorter timescale. Working in human cells modified to carry his unique mutation, it took them less than two months.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The next step was to get approval from America’s Food and Drug Administration (<small>FDA</small>) to give <small>KJ </small>the therapy. This required the researchers to demonstrate that the editor worked and was safe. They did this by inserting <small>KJ</small>’s mutation into mice and using the editor to edit <small>DNA </small>in their liver cells, where ammonia conversion happens. Around 42% of the mice’s liver cells were edited, enough to suggest a therapeutic effect might be possible in <small>KJ</small>. Following a small number of safety tests in monkeys, the <small>FDA </small>gave its permission.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">As part of the treatment protocol, <small>KJ </small>was given his first intravenous dose in February, a second dose 22 days later and a final third dose in April. To ensure the editors reached his liver cells, the doctors wrapped them in tiny bubbles of fat called lipid nanoparticles—the same vehicle that delivered the covid-19 m<small>RNA</small> vaccines—which carried them naturally to the liver.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><small>KJ</small>’s ammonia levels improved significantly after that and his doctors were able to decrease the amount of medication he needed to take in order to keep them in check. The most important test, says Dr Ahrens-Nicklas, came when he contracted a virus. In kids with <small>CPS</small>1 deficiency, infection tends to send their ammonia levels flying. <small>KJ</small>’s stayed normal.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">“They’ve done a great job if they’ve managed to put that together for an individual patient that needs treatment in the first few months of life,” says Waseem Qasim, a cell- and gene-therapy specialist at University College London and a paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital, who was not involved with the work. Whereas most new gene-editing therapies work by turning off mangled genes, rather than correcting mutations, says Dr Qasim, “This is cleverer.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Drs Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru hope that <small>KJ</small>’s case will be the first of many, a vision shared by their collaborator Fyodor Urnov of the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. He connected the team with Danaher, a life-sciences company, which produced the editor. Now, Dr Urnov says, “We can never look back.” The years-long approach to drug development works for diseases that do not kill or disable very quickly. But in cases where a child born with a unique mutation needs treatment within months, he believes this new approach has to become the standard. He hopes diagnosis, production, testing and approval could one day be done in less than a month.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Baby steps</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Much more monitoring is needed to know if <small>KJ</small>’s improvement is permanent and whether he will continue to need the medication he was previously on. For now, though, there is cause for optimism. His disease could have been a death sentence.

Companies like <small>MOJU</small> and Suja juice, an American brand<small>, </small>tout the immunity-boosting properties of the daily dose. Plenish advertises similar such products as “Turmeric Recovery” and “Berry Gut Health”, which it says are nutrient-packed, providing “100% of the recommended daily intake” of various vitamins. Are these trendy tonics a shortcut to good health?</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Ginger has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine and in Ayurveda, a system of medicine that originated in India. Although robust clinical trials in this field are few, there is some evidence to show that ginger can help with ailments ranging from nausea to inflammation. Turmeric, a plant closely related to ginger, may also be helpful. Curcumin, the active compound in the plant, has been shown to ease pain and reduce levels of cholesterol.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Berry-based shots are also proving popular. The fruits have several health benefits. In one randomised, placebo-controlled trial 61 men and women aged 65 to 80 consumed a mixture made up of 26 grams of freeze-dried whole berries every day for 12 weeks. The results, published in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> in 2023, showed that those who had the powder scored more highly on tests of memory and attention, and had lower blood pressure than those given the placebo. A trial led by researchers at Washington State University in October 2024 found that drinking about 355 grams of elderberry juice every day for a week results in a healthier gut microbiome and improves the body’s ability to manage and regulate glucose levels.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But do these benefits translate to commercialised juice shots? <small>MOJU </small>has conducted some clinical trials to prove the efficacy of their own concoctions. One small study, conducted in collaboration with London South Bank University, and published in <i>Foods</i>, a journal, tested the benefits of <small>MOJU’</small>s prebiotic daily shot—which combines apple, lemon, ginger, and raspberry juices (among other ingredients)—on 14 healthy individuals for three weeks. The results suggested they could affect the gut microbiome in beneficial ways.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Vasantha Rupasinghe, a food scientist at Dalhousie University, says that concentrated juice shots (such as<small> </small><small>MOJU</small>’s) can be a handy way to get beneficial nutrients. Anthocyanins, a group of antioxidants found in some berries, for instance, lower blood pressure only if enough are consumed. Dr Rupasinghe notes that a single shot may contain as many as multiple servings of berries.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">But proceed with caution: some natural substances present in juice can be toxic in high quantities. A juice’s other ingredients also matter: the body is better able to absorb curcumin, for example, when it is combined with piperine, a compound in black pepper.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Eating whole fruit, sticky and time-consuming as it may be, may offer certain advantages over fruit-based shots. Juicing often removes a fruit’s pulp and skin, for example, where much of the fibre integral to healthy digestion is stored. Skin is also rich in antioxidants, which are thought to protect against cancer and heart disease.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All in all, there is some evidence to suggest that the occasional properly processed juice shot is beneficial, and little evidence of harm. For the busy commuter, a $2.48 shot from Walmart will probably do no damage to anything but their wallet. Though it may be better (and cheaper) to have some fruit.<span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>Curious about the world?

Picador; £20</i></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><span data-caps=\"initial\">O</span><small>ur forefathers</small> had some odd ideas about fatherhood. In ancient Athens, a baby was not legally a person until its father said it was. At a ceremony called the <i>amphidromia</i>, the patriarch would hold up the newborn for inspection and either welcome it into his household or abandon it on a hillside to face near-certain death. Typical reasons for rejecting an infant included deformity or the mere fact that it was a girl.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All this may sound horrible today, but some of it had a harsh underlying logic. For most of history, a man had no reliable way to tell whether he was the biological father of a child and, in a world where nearly everyone was poor, most were reluctant to risk wasting bread on another man’s offspring. Many therefore asserted oppressive control over female fertility, forbidding their wives and daughters to mingle with other men and—in the Athenian case—claiming the right to kill any child they did not wish to acknowledge.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Men have long shaped the law to their advantage. Fully a third of the rules in the 4,000-year-old code of Hammurabi, a Babylonian king, cover domestic relations. Alert readers of the big phallic stone on which they are inscribed will detect a certain pro-dad bias. A son who strikes his father should have his hands cut off, for instance, and a wife who plots to murder her husband should be publicly impaled.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In “Fatherhood: A History of Love and Power”, Augustine Sedgewick, an American scholar, describes how <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/03/22/is-neurotic-parenting-worse-than-bad-parenting\">thinking about dads has changed over time</a>. What is striking is the sheer variety of nonsense that people have believed.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Aristotle argued that hotter sex and livelier semen were more likely to generate a male child. Sigmund Freud believed that all boys secretly yearn to kill dad and have sex with mum. (Spoiler warning: many don’t.) Saint Augustine of Hippo, an influential early Christian, observed the selfish behaviour of his infant son (who died in childhood) and conceived the notion of “original sin”: that a baby inherits wickedness from its father, transmitted by the act of sex itself. The father in turn inherits sin from his father, and so on, all the way back to Adam. This became church dogma, and was used to justify infant baptism.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Another common theme is cruelty. Martin Luther is reputed to have said he “would rather have a dead son than a disobedient one”. In 1662 Virginia’s colonial government scrapped the old English tradition that status passed from father to son, decreeing that children should inherit it from their mothers instead. This was not, as it sounds, a breakthrough for early feminism. It was so that male plantation owners could impregnate their slaves, secure in the knowledge that the offspring would also be chattel. This rule greatly increased the market value of enslaved women, since it gave the buyer ownership of all their descendants. It also “joined blackness to enslavement”, since “slavery was defined as heritable and congenital, rather than a consequence of capture, military defeat or indebtedness.” The dismal consequences of this rule are still felt in race relations throughout the Americas.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In modern times, two big changes have affected how people view fatherhood. One is that, thanks to <small>DNA</small> tests, “For the first time in human history, it has become possible to establish paternity with certainty.” The other is that fathers <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/11/28/fathers-are-doing-more-child-care-in-east-asia\">spend more time on child care</a> than ever before. Women earn more than in the past, thanks to reliable contraception, the spread of education and the (partial) triumph of feminism. No longer needing a husband’s wages to feed and clothe their offspring, they can be <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/28/why-the-state-should-not-promote-marriage\">pickier about whom (or whether) they marry</a>. This in turn has allowed them to demand a fairer division of labour at home—even as washing machines and food-delivery apps have freed up time for child care. And though perfect equality is some way off, most modern dads have found that co-parenting is deeply rewarding.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Now is probably the best time ever to be a father, at least in rich countries. Many employers offer generous <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/07/20/fathers-face-higher-penalties-for-taking-parental-leave-than-mothers-do\">paternity leave</a>; in much of Europe, they are required to. American dads do three times as much child care today as they did in the 1960s. When covid-19 forced them to stay at home in 2020-21, the habit partly stuck: when the pandemic ended, the time American dads spent on child care remained higher than it had been in 2019.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The notion that it is unmanly to read bedtime stories is now hopelessly out of date: men are more likely than women to say they wish they <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/11/27/parents-now-spend-twice-as-much-time-with-their-children-as-50-years-ago\">saw more of the rugrats</a>. Whereas their grandads enforced discipline with smacks, today’s fathers are more gentle and talkative. Children have benefited from more-engaged dads, not least because mothers and fathers often parent in complementary ways. As Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution observes in “Of Boys and Men”, dads are more likely to encourage openness to the world and a bit of risk-taking. Paternal involvement tends to reduce adolescent delinquency. Teenage girls who are close to their fathers exhibit better mental health as adults.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Popular culture has embraced the shift towards less hierarchical households. No television studio today would produce a show like “Father Knows Best”, an American sitcom of the 1950s with a self-explanatory title. If anything, the trend is towards portraying dads as doofuses. In “Family Guy”, a cartoon, the father, Peter Griffin, is so stupid that he jealously punches a killer whale that nuzzles his wife at Sea World.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Daddy issues</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The blessings of greater equality have come with a big caveat, however. Not all men have adapted well to the new world. Whereas college-educated dads in America are spending more time with their children, their less-educated peers are spending slightly less than they did 20 years ago. They are also far more likely to live apart from their kids and hardly see them at all. This has created a class divide in parenting, with the financial advantages that upper-middle-class children have always enjoyed compounded by a more stable and stimulating home environment.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Many working-class men, meanwhile, are missing out entirely on the joys of fatherhood: now that women can afford to be pickier, more men are being left on the shelf. Many resent it intensely, and this has fed a politics of male grievance in much of the developed world.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Disappointingly, Mr Sedgewick fails to grapple with these trends. Instead, he concludes on a personal note. When he asks his young son what a father should be, the boy replies that a dad should be “funny and good at hugging”. As parenting advice goes, that is hard to beat. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/15/why-the-best-time-to-be-a-dad-is-now\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The schedulers of the Women’s National Basketball Association (<small>WNBA</small>) have picked a game with muscle. The Lynx have won four titles, a joint record. The Wings, meanwhile, have snapped up this year’s most exciting recruit in Paige Bueckers, a 23-year-old point guard. Thanks to her, the Wings’ ticket sales so far are up almost 350% from last season.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">The <small>WNBA</small> is powering forward. Last year a total of 54m viewers tuned in to watch the regular season, almost double the number that watched in 2022. Games broadcast on <small>espn</small> attracted an average of 1.2m viewers in America; 1.5m watched the equivalent matches in the men’s league across all channels. (Men make up 60% of the <small>WNBA</small>’s audience, in part because the league plays when the <small>NBA </small>does not.) And next year a new <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/07/25/a-shift-in-the-media-business-is-changing-what-it-is-to-be-a-sports-fan\">media-rights deal</a> will come into effect, worth $200m a year. This will make the <small>WNBA</small> the most valuable women’s sports league in the world, surpassing the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/16/womens-football-is-becoming-bigger-and-better\">National Women’s Soccer League</a>. How did it get so popular?</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In the past decade, women’s basketball has become easier to find and watch. <small>WNBA</small> matches used to be broadcast sporadically, on obscure channels and at random times of the day. In 2015 <small>ESPN</small> televised only 11 games in the season. “You had to guess when it would be on,” remembers David Berri of Southern Utah University.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In 2021, to mark the league’s 25th anniversary season, mainstream networks agreed to increase their programming and broadcast at least 100 games. (This season more than 175 will be televised or streamed.) <small>ESPN</small> began offering more coverage of women’s college basketball too. Viewers could tune in for the annual “March Madness” knockout tournament as well as the draft, in which <small>wnba </small>teams select new players. “It’s not a magic trick to get people to watch women’s sports,” says Howard Megdal, a sports writer. “You simply need to give people access.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">As in other leagues, stars have played a vital role in winning the sport new fans. Athletes such as Cameron Brink and Angel Reese have shone on the court. The brightest talent is <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/05/10/caitlin-clark-will-always-be-underpaid\">Caitlin Clark</a> (pictured, left), a point guard for Indiana Fever, who scored 122 three-pointers in her debut season last year, after finishing college in Iowa. Much as people watch the Premier League to see spectacular goals, fans want to watch Ms Clark effortlessly float a ball into the basket from a great distance. She has greatly accelerated interest in the league, argues Mr Megdal: “An incline on a graph turned more or less into a straight [vertical] line.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All of which means that <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2023/06/15/which-sport-is-the-best-business\">money is flowing in</a>. Last year companies jumped to sponsor the league and its players. (Ms Clark made $11m.) Investors are spying opportunities. New teams in Portland, San Francisco and Toronto will have joined by 2026, and rumours swirl around several more cities. In February a bid of $250m was made to add a franchise in Cleveland. Consider that in 1975, at roughly the same point in the <small>NBA</small>’s history, the Boston Celtics sold for $4m ($24m in today’s prices). That team is now worth $6bn.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">To follow a similar trajectory, the <small>WNBA</small> will need to find more foreign viewers—and household names. Today the <small>NBA</small> has the most followers on social media of any domestic sports league in the world. Almost 70% of fans who engage with it online live outside America. Many of the league’s stars learned the game elsewhere. Giannis Antetokounmpo grew up in Greece to Nigerian parents. Joel Embiid was born in Cameroon. The international male talent pool is such that the United States finished fourth at the most recent World Cup, behind Germany, Serbia and Canada. By contrast, the American women’s team has lost just one match at the Olympics and World Cup in three decades. For Indiana Fever to catch on globally, it would help for the next Ms Clark to turn up not in Des Moines, but Dakar, Dalian or Dortmund. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/15/the-wnba-will-soon-be-the-most-valuable-league-in-womens-sport\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

The shooting in her apartment block is the inexorable ending of “Words of War”, a new film about her life and fate. Politkovskaya’s story and warnings are vital even now, amid the carnage in Ukraine. Especially now.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Already out in America and released in Britain in June, “Words of War” opens in 2004, when Politkovskaya (played by Maxine Peake, pictured above) was poisoned en route to the mass hostage crisis in Beslan, southern Russia. It spools back to depict her coverage in <i>Novaya Gazeta,</i> a beacon of independent journalism, of the Kremlin’s second war in <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2024/04/16/what-to-read-to-understand-chechnya\">restive Chechnya</a>, which began in 1999 and oiled Vladimir Putin’s ascent.

One is with Dmitry Muratov (Ciarán Hinds), her editor, who <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2021/10/16/a-russian-editor-says-he-won-the-nobel-because-his-slain-colleagues-could-not\">in 2021 would win the Nobel peace prize</a>. A second is with her husband (Jason Isaacs) and anguished children. The third is with Mr Putin, a spectral presence whom she denounces as “a vain, brutal, power-hungry authoritarian”.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Artistically and historically, the drama has limitations, only some inevitable. It leaves out <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/16/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-the-brutal-chechen-leader-claiming-to-be-in-ukraine\">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, a Chechen warlord whom Politkovskaya enraged. Chechnya did indeed become the hellhole that the film suggests, but in reality is beautiful as well as benighted. In this Russia it is snowing even in summer. The heroine negotiates with the terrorists who seize a theatre in Moscow in 2002; but the script omits the actual Politkovskaya’s hunch that some Russian spooks had enabled the attack, a view which was not, to her, a conspiracy theory but a plausible Russian scenario.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">All the same, the film captures her moral clarity, bravery and mordant wit. And it conveys her belief that, against the odds and the ruthless enemies she made, her work could make a difference. Her devotion to her profession, and her faith in it, are one reason her story still matters.</p><div class=\"css-0 enls6fv0\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img alt=\"Anna Politkovskaya works at her desk\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP504.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Photograph: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In America and elsewhere, trust in the media is at dismal lows—hardly surprising given the “fake news” mantra with which politicians lazily fend off awkward truths. Other screen portrayals of the profession don’t much help. A few hacks are dogged crusaders, as in “Spotlight” or “She Said”; others are venal cynics. Fictional female reporters have a weird habit of sleeping with their sources.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Yet as disinformation and crankery swamp the facts,&nbsp;principled journalism like Politkovskaya’s has rarely been more essential. Nor more perilous: globally, the Committee to Protect Journalists counts at least 25 reporters murdered because of their work last year. Many more died doing their jobs in danger zones. Often, as in Politkovskaya’s case, the ultimate culprits are not caught.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Besides being a journalist, her other salient characteristic is that she was a Russian. This is not a category of victim liable to attract much sympathy just now. As it happens, that was true of Chechens when she chronicled their suffering. Many Russians reviled them as bandits and fanatics, not seeing that Chechnya prefigured the wider country’s fate in miniature: a lawless place, with no one to complain to. Few Westerners cared about the fiddly little region, nor, in those days, about Russia’s other abuses—unless its corruption jeopardised their assets, or its violence erupted on their streets in extraterritorial hits.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Part of Politkovskaya’s message, though, was that horrors in a distant land should not be blithely ignored from the apparent safety of another. Fascists and despots, after all, tend not to respect borders, internal or otherwise. “Do you still think”, she asks in the film, “that if there is a war in one place, it has no bearing on another and that you can sit it out in peace?” The link to Ukraine isn’t mentioned. It doesn’t need to be.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Politkovskaya’s death was a milestone and omen in Russia’s slide into tyranny. Her life sets an awesome standard of courage. Like Alexei Navalny, another poisoning survivor who was later killed, her heroism can almost seem an alibi for inaction—as if the choice were between sacrificing yourself for a cause and doing nothing. But the moral of her story is not that ordinary mortals must decry autocrats or call out war criminals. You just have to pay attention, before it’s too late. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/13/anna-politkovskaya-knew-that-tyranny-respects-no-borders\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

In 1608 <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/09/05/waiter-theres-a-fork-in-my-soup\">Thomas Coryat</a>, an Englishman sometimes called “the world’s first backpacker”, embarked on a Grand Tour of Europe. Friendless and on foot, Coryat discovered foreign delicacies (“frogs used for food”) and newfangled technologies (“forks used in feeding”).</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Four centuries later, nomads move faster and farther than Coryat did, for <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/01/22/why-low-cost-airlines-sell-so-many-tickets-for-so-little\">cheap flights</a> and mobile phones have made things more straightforward. Yet many are following his lead and setting off alone. In the past decade Google searches for “solo travel” have more than doubled. In Britain the share of travellers going on holiday by themselves has nearly tripled, says the Association of British Travel Agents,<i> </i>from 6% in 2011 to 17% in 2024.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Why are so many people going it alone? Just as Grand Tours became a rite of passage for young noblemen, solo travel today is less about finding far-flung places than finding yourself. Hilton, a hospitality company, calls the trend “me-mooning” (as opposed to “honeymooning”). Travel bloggers attest that on <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/07/18/the-worlds-top-beaches-a-statisticians-guide\">white-sand beaches</a> in Bali or Belize you can “become a truer version of yourself”.</p><div class=\"css-0 enls6fv0\"><figure class=\"css-3mn275 e1197rjj0\"><img alt=\"Tourist exploring the city in Hong Kong Island\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" sizes=\"(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw\" srcset=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg 1424w\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20250517_CUP505.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-1dkrsla e15o9k8g2\"><span class=\"css-1st60ou e15o9k8g1\">Photograph: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Those not searching for themselves are looking for an adventure. People “travel not to go anywhere, but to go”, as <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2001/05/17/only-omit\">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, the author of “Treasure Island”, put it. Solo travellers describe the thrill of doing whatever they want, whenever they want. Research has shown that self-imposed solitude can boost creativity and well-being.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">And, rather than hanging out with the mates they have, many travel alone in order to meet new friends and lovers. The isolation of the pandemic made people “more open” to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/07/10/the-vital-art-of-talking-to-strangers\">roaming with strangers</a>, says Lee Thompson of Flash Pack, a tour operator. The firm, which uses the slogan “arrive solo, leave as friends”, now takes twice as many bookings as it did before covid-19.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Millennials and Gen Z are particularly keen on travelling: they spend a larger share of their income on trips than their older peers do, says McKinsey, a consultancy. Many are <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/08/16/is-western-culture-stopping-people-from-growing-up\">deferring getting married and having children</a>, so have the flexibility to head off on jaunts when they please. On TikTok influencers preach the virtues of independent excursions: “Stop waiting for someone to join you.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Women, in particular, are embracing that mantra: by one estimate, 84% of solo travellers are female. A century ago etiquette books warned women not to travel without a male chaperone; today many say they are not afraid to travel unaccompanied (though safety tips are readily available online). Much as Coryat did 400 years ago, women today have the means, and the time, to follow their feet. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/12/travel-buddies-are-out-solo-trips-are-in\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Rapid escalation between America and China in early April threatened to hit the smartphones it makes in China and sells in America with 145% tariffs. Then, on May 12th, a preliminary deal was reached, sending tariffs for most Chinese imports down to 30% for 90 days.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">No one knows what will happen next. But Apple has reportedly scrambled to move some iPhone production from China to India. The uncertainty about its future has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off its market value. Despite the deal, on May 13th Apple’s share price was still down by 13% since the start of the year.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Any decision to pivot away from China will not come easily for Tim Cook, Apple’s boss and the man behind the company’s hefty presence there. A new book by Patrick McGee, a journalist at the <i>Financial Times</i>, explains how Apple became inseparable from China and what the fracturing of global trade means for one of the world’s most valuable companies. (Apple says the book is riddled with inaccuracies and rejects many of its claims.)</p><div data-optimizely=\"onward-articles-component\" style=\"display:none\" class=\"css-1dmm17z ejvhmuq1\"><div

The idea that parts—let alone machines—would be made outside a company’s watch, or outside America, was alien to the early computer industry. But, in the late 1990s, “Apple began to abandon this strategy,” Mr McGee writes, “in favour of offshoring its production to contract manufacturers.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">China was in a strong position. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/01/09/foxconn-and-other-gadget-makers-are-expanding-their-empires\">Foxconn</a>, a Taiwanese pioneer of contract manufacturing, had been instrumental in training China’s vast but largely unskilled labour force in the 1990s. Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, is credited with being a deft political operator who persuaded local governments in China to provide his company with big subsidies. This allowed Foxconn to buy the world’s best machinery for its Chinese factories, which gave them an edge over rivals.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Once Apple handed over production of its music player, the iPod, to Foxconn, sales of the device soared from fewer than 1m in 2003 to more than 22m in 2005. This success was replicated on an even bigger scale with the iPhone, starting in 2007. Critics said conditions at Foxconn were inhumane; several workers committed suicide. But the low costs forced others to move to China. Soon it was too expensive to manufacture electronics anywhere else.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">By 2015 Apple was investing somewhere in the region of $55bn per year in China. It flies in a constant stream of thousands of engineers to train suppliers. Yet in recent years Apple’s dependency on an authoritarian regime has appeared less sensible. Under the rule of Xi Jinping, China’s supreme leader, officials have wanted more and more from the firm, often in the form of technology transfers. Mr Xi has also wanted Chinese people to buy local devices, such as those made by Huawei, rather than foreign ones. Officials have been told to stop buying iPhones. Apple’s smartphone sales in China have tumbled.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr McGee excels at describing the intricacies of supply chains. Yet some of his political analysis fails to convince. It is unlikely, for example, that Mr Xi was personally involved in state media attacks on Apple. But his timely book poses a question for investors and policymakers alike: can the company thrive without China? If the answer is no, then a failure to end the trade war will bruise Apple even more deeply than the global economy. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/13/can-apple-extricate-itself-from-china\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

Allen Lane; £40</i></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><span data-caps=\"initial\">T</span><small>HE OCTAGONAL</small> study overlooks the green of Elmira College in upstate New York. In it, Mark Twain wrote “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer”, “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court”, along with umpteen other stories, articles and speeches. Twain spent his most productive summers on his wife’s family’s farm in Elmira, writing by day and reading his work to his wife and children on the porch in the evening. The unusual shape notwithstanding, the study is small, austere and unremarkable—three words that are in every way the opposite of Twain’s life.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In fact, argues Ron Chernow in a titanic new biography, Twain was “the largest literary personality that America has produced”. He is the first literary figure to receive the Chernow treatment: in the past the Pulitzer-prizewinning biographer has focused on tycoons (John D. Rockefeller), <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/10/05/todays-historians-have-a-higher-opinion-of-ulysses-s-grant\">presidents</a> (George Washington) and treasury secretaries (Alexander Hamilton, a book which, improbably, inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda’s <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2015/12/16/patriotism-on-broadway\">hit musical</a>).</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr Chernow argues that Twain “fairly invented our celebrity culture”. It is true that Twain’s biting wit, along with his oratorical and self-promotional skills, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2010/04/15/more-than-just-a-phunny-phellow\">made him a star</a>, as beloved by the crowds who packed into halls to watch him speak as by presidents and the literati. But that is not why generations of American children read him in school, nor why he still deserves to be read today. What he really invented was a way of being American in the world and on the page: bold, irreverent and unpretentious. Twain was the laureate of America’s unruly adolescence.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens on November 30th 1835, Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri. His father was anxious, stern and, as Mr Chernow notes, “forbiddingly humourless”; his mother was pious and quick-witted. Like Abraham Lincoln, Twain was a product of the American frontier. What he lacked in formal education he made up for in ambition.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Hannibal sits on the banks of the Mississippi river, which, in the pre-railroad days, was perhaps America’s most important commercial artery. The river gave the author his name: the cry “mark twain” from a boatman meant that the river was of safely navigable depth. To him the river represented liberty and a connection to the wider world. In his most famous novel, “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, Huck (the narrator) and Jim (his enslaved companion) were free and relatively equal on the water, but harassed by the law and a host of unsavoury characters on land.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Twain’s upbringing put him in close contact with black Americans. The Missouri of Twain’s youth was a slave state. His father owned and rented people. His mother took a dim view of abolitionism. Yet as a boy Twain enjoyed listening to people telling stories in the “negro quarter” of his uncle’s farm. He became an ardent opponent not just of slavery, but of racial discrimination in almost any form.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">In his writings he railed against the vile bigotry common in his day and supported women’s suffrage long before it was popular. William Dean Howells, Twain’s editor at the <i>Atlantic</i>, called him “the most desouthernised southerner I ever met. No man more perfectly sensed and more entirely abhorred slavery.”</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">That abhorrence comes through clearly in “Huckleberry Finn”, from which Ernest Hemingway claimed “all modern American literature comes”. Twain quipped in a preface to the novel that “Persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.” Both moral and plot are evident in the book. In its celebration of vernacular speech, sympathy with the underdog and lack of pretence, the book created a uniquely American style of fiction.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Jim was Twain’s most radical creation. Readers today might be put off by his stereotypical dialect, superstition and devotion to Huck, but he was perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/14/whats-behind-the-wave-of-literary-retellings\">first nuanced black character written by a white novelist</a>. Jim is thoughtful and decent, possessed of all the compassion that Huck’s own father, an abusive drunkard, never provided, Mr Chernow argues.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Once a mainstay of school curricula, in recent years “Huckleberry Finn” has fallen out of favour. The book is “banned from most American secondary schools”, Mr Chernow writes, “and its repetitive use of the n-word has cast a shadow over Twain’s reputation.” But readers who see past the use of that ugly word (common in Twain’s time) will find a work that—in its panoply of cruel southern whites blind to Jim’s intellect and manifest virtues—shows how bigotry not only harms its victims, but also deforms the people who spout it.</p><h2 class=\"css-1vv6jyl e18nv6n10\">Huck yes</h2><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Mr Chernow devotes curiously little space to the novel. Instead, his biography spends a great deal of its 1,200 pages on topics such as the young Twain’s hair-care habits, his opinion on street cleaning in the city of Buffalo and his disappointments later in life. By around page 700 even the most devoted Twainiac may wish the book had a more vigorous editor.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Still, Mr Chernow’s doorstopper is worth reading for its portrait of an author sure of himself and his gifts, even as he toiled as a steamboat pilot or printer’s devil, and its insight into the frenetic, violent, optimistic country that made him. <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/15/mark-twain-was-a-literary-celebrity-with-a-moral-compass\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"

They had laid the meat—it was whitish, cut in slivers as thin as matchsticks—on a makeshift aluminium tray. Later, the boys would find that if they cooked it, it tasted better: like beef, but softer. But on that first day they just ate it raw, almost frozen. Some swallowed it like medicine. One ate it with snow, to mask the taste. He still gagged. One joked that it was like a fine delicatessen ham.&nbsp;Álvaro could not eat it at all. He wanted to: they all knew that eating it was their only hope of living. They also all knew that to eat it they had to die a little, first.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Later, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 would become many things to many people. It would become a film, a book, a parable, an inspiration and a management research paper (“Enacting project resilience: Insights from Uruguayan air force flight 571’s crash in the Andes”).&nbsp;It would be called many things, too: it would be called the “miracle” of the Andes and the “tragedy” of them. Certainly it had tragic elements. There was hubris: just before the crash, the pilot and co-pilot were so relaxed they chatted and drank tea. There was dramatic irony: their plane, they said, was so modern it “practically flies itself”. Moments later, both were dead.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Above all, it had the miasma. That terrible, tragic pollution from which Álvaro Mangino could never escape. Just as in a tragedy, the realisation of the pollution dawned slowly on the watching audience. In 1972, the world was captivated by the disappearance of the plane and its young passengers (most were students). It was even more captivated when, after 72 days, some were found alive. How, people asked in joy, had they survived? What birds had they eaten? What lichen? Álvaro could not lie. The crash site was 11,500 feet up: there were no birds; no lichen. They had eaten each other.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Flight 571 should have just been fun: it was taking a young Uruguayan rugby team and a few others to Chile for a match. And at first it was fun. Then the plane started to jolt, violently. One student started to say the “Our Father”. Mountain peaks appeared in the windows, far too close. He switched to the “Hail Mary”: a shorter prayer; for speedier salvation. Salvation never came. A little after 3:30pm, the plane hit the mountain. The right wing sheared off; then the left. Slim as a toboggan, the fuselage slid down the mountain, before coming to rest in the Valley of Tears.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">People had often wondered what would happen to young people if they were somehow suddenly stripped of society. Almost two decades earlier, William Golding had answered with “Lord of the Flies”; with anarchy and cruelty. Álvaro and those on Flight 571 answered instead with a new society. Their proto-society started to form almost as soon as the plane stopped. Two medical students, Roberto and Gustavo, moved among the injured; Roberto dressing wounds, taking pulses, tying a tourniquet.<b> </b>The next morning, a hierarchy appeared; and jobs. Some melted snow for water; others planned expeditions to get help. When, after the crash, there was an avalanche, they worked together to recover from it. Later, some came to call it (as the journalist Pablo Vierci noted in his book of the same name) the “society of the snow”.</p><div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu adComponent_hidden__Dp0GM css-0 e1cbnkh80\"><div><div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"></div></div></div><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Álvaro could do little for this society at first. After the crash, he had been trapped beneath the twisted seats. When they got him out he saw his left leg, beneath the knee, was completely loose. Just hanging there, as if it didn’t belong to him. Roberto had rolled up his trouser leg, looked at the fracture, then told Álvaro not to look. He gave a sharp movement; it cracked; Álvaro shrieked.&nbsp;The bone was reset. Later, Álvaro asked a surgeon if it should be redone. The surgeon said: he could not do better than Roberto. Roberto had, then, seemed so old. He had been 19. After the crash, he had worn a woolly jumper his mother had given him, for comfort.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">And above all, the society had its notorious initiation. Each member of the society justified what Roberto would call that “depraved” moment in their own way. One justified it with theology. It was like the Eucharist: take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you. Roberto saw it as biology: he had studied the Krebs cycle. He knew protein can transform into sugar. He knew that all the nutrients they needed were there, in the bodies of their friends who had already died. Álvaro later described it with bureaucracy. There were three lists: the list of those who survived the crash; the list of those who survived the avalanche; the list of those who survived to the end. To make it into the third you had to eat.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">It was the hardest decision of his life. So hard that, on that first day, he couldn’t manage to do it. But he dragged himself out of the fuselage and along the snow to watch the others eat; to say “I am with you guys.” Then he became a “cutter”. His job was to chop the meat into minuscule pieces, so small that there was no hint of what it was. They all found it easier to eat if they did not know whether the meat came from a hand, or a leg. At first, they just ate the muscles. Eventually, they ate everything: the kidneys; the liver; the heart. Finally, they cracked open the skulls with an axe and ate the brains and spooned the marrow from the bones.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">Then, finally, on December 21st, the society of the snow made contact with outside society. One of the expeditions encountered a horseman; another man went to fetch help. Two months after the crash, helicopters arrived. Society welcomed them back with joy—and with the questions that Álvaro so hated. How had they survived? Álvaro said: dead bodies. He had hoped for compassion. Instead, he saw shock. For years after, when he worked as a businessman and even at home, to his own family, he didn’t speak about it. Happiness, he felt, was ephemeral.</p><p data-component=\"paragraph\" class=\"css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0\">There had been one, final, list. The parents of the children on Flight 571 knew that survivors had been found and that some of their children were still alive. But they were not told whose. Álvaro’s father flew to Santiago. When he arrived, he was handed a list of names: the survivors. He took it and read. There, eleventh on the list of sixteen, was Álvaro. His father let out a howl.<b> <span class=\"ufinish\">■</span></b></p></div></section><p class=\"text-end\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/obituary/2025/05/15/alvaro-mangino-survived-a-plane-crash-by-eating-his-companions\" target=\"_blank\">分享</a></p><br>"
